# 1. Introduction
Nowadays, choosing furniture for our home might be a challenge due to its variety. In the light of the problem, our team want to introduce an application that helps the customers by suggesting which can be placed to a room from our products. Customers will upload a picture of the room which is required to be filled and our system will take care of the rest.
# 2. Problem Statement
## 2.1 The Challenges
### Detecting empty spaces in a room
The empty space would be marked including its dimension. But how it can be detected?
### Choosing products to be placed
Suppose that we have all of the information about these empty spaces, which one from our product should be placed in?
### Overall aesthetic
Colours?
## 2.2 The pain points
Data, 3D model for visualisation, computing cost.
## 2.3 The Landscape
Currently, we don't have any 3D model which is required to bring the objects to real life via AR.
# 3. Solution Overview

# 4. Methodologies
**Objects detection**: detecting objects and its properties (colour, dimension). When a space is empty (no object), its dimension shall be calculated. [1911.09299.pdf](file:///C:/Users/phucn/Desktop/1911.09299.pdf)
**Recommended system**: determining which one should be placed and satisfies the surrounding objects (colours, its category,...).
**AR**: visualising how the objects look likes when it is in place (scaled to fit).
# 5. Core Functionality
Customers could find it's easy to operating.
Detecting the empty space and determining the appropriate furniture.
The company should approach more customers.

An important component is showing potential employers you have the skills and passion. Even without a degree you can show this by doing personal projects that you showcase on a portfolio website. I&#39;ve made a collab video with Ken Jee showing how to create a portfolio website. Let me find the link to it and post here in a short while.,2021-04-23T09:33:39Z

I am a Windows user, I use anaconda and VS. I first created a new environment using anaconda, and run it again using anaconda. Then, I create a folder on the desktop and within that folder, I create <a href=""http://app.py/"">app.py</a> using vs. I do not have base or stream environment when write the code in vs terminal. My directory seems to be the folder that is on the desktop. I was able to run all the codes you showed here.

Google has invested 300 million dollars in anthropic, a company that develops large language models. Microsoft has introduced Bing Chat, a chatbot that can have conversations with users and provide up-to-date references. Google&#39;s chatbot has been criticized for getting a factually incorrect answer, which caused the company&#39;s stock to drop. Microsoft, on the other hand, is perceived well despite its chatbot&#39;s weird interactions.,The text discusses the potential benefits of Google investing in anthropic technology, in light of the recent problems Microsoft has had with its chatbot. It is suggested that Google may be better equipped to deal with the issue of aligning their models, due to their experience with artificial intelligence.,The text discusses how Google&#39;s AI technology is lagging behind in comparison to other companies. Google is trying to catch up, but it is difficult because they have to meet high expectations. The author suggests that it may be helpful for Google to spin off their AI technology into a separate, independent startup.,The text discusses the idea that large language models can be used to learn algorithmic reasoning, and that once this logic is learned, it can be applied to solve problems that are not related to language. The author notes that there are many small startups that are using the open AI API to build their models, and that this is likely to multiply in the future.,The text discusses how businesses can leverage existing data and tools to create new, innovative products and services. One way to do this is by fine-tuning existing models to better fit their domain, or by prompting the model with specific domain-related questions. Another way is to reach out to external sources of information, like APIs, to get the data and knowledge they need.,The text discusses the three different ways that AI can be used to generate knowledge. The first is prompting, which involves taking the output of an AI and aligning it to a specific field. The second is training the AI on a small set of domain-specific data. The third is training the AI from scratch, which requires a large data set.,The text discusses how a proof of concept is more important than a perfect model for a startup, and how investors will be excited by a product that is flexible and allows users to be creative. The author also mentions that the cost of entry for AI startups is low, and that the biggest challenge is finding the right market for the product.,The text discusses the changing landscape of the coding industry, and how the barrier to entry for creating innovative products is lowered by the relatively easy ability to prompt models to do hard things. It encourages people to play with these models and see what they can do with them, as they have the potential to change the dynamics of the world as we know it.",2023-03-27T15:13:37Z

This approach has been proposed as a way to avoid the need for human feedback.,The text discusses how a chatbot could be used to help customers choose their favorite pizza, and how the model could be aligned to avoid producing outputs that are abrasive or offensive. One way to do this is to use human feedback to rank the outputs, so that the model will not preferentially choose outputs that are abrasive. Another way is to prompt the model with questions like &quot;is there anything offensive in this phrase pineapple pizza sucks?&quot; to get it to identify abrasive content.,The text defines the term &quot;emergent ability&quot;, and explains how scale affects the ability of emergent abilities to show up. It also introduces the concept of a &quot;foundation model&quot;, which is a model that exhibits emerging abilities. Foundation models have specific challenges that come from scale, data, and the need to be evaluated on different tasks.,The text discusses the potential for prompt injection attacks on AI systems, and how these attacks could be used to extract sensitive information or cause other disasters. The author notes that protecting against prompt injection is difficult, as it requires interpretation of the user&#39;s intention, and that there will likely be many layers of protection against these attacks in the future.,The text discusses the limitations of current language models, specifically in terms of the size of the context window that the models can keep in working memory. The text also notes that there is currently no set metric for determining when emergent properties will occur in a model.,The text discusses the potential of using artificial intelligence (AI) to create models that can learn and retrieve information from external sources. The author notes that while this technology is still in development, it has the potential to revolutionize search engines and other applications.,The text describes a new artificial intelligence system that can automatically carry out tasks based on prompts, without the need for human coding.

Luca argues that while some people may be concerned that these techniques are leading to artificial intelligence that is too human-like, the reality is that they are simply providing more value than ever before. He cites the example of a person in HR who is using AI to help screen resumes, and notes that this is just one example of how AI is benefiting people in a direct way.,The text discusses the development of chatbots and how they are becoming more natural and fluent. It also mentions that there are many open source alternatives to the chatbot GPT3, which is based on scraped data.,The text describes a method for training a machine learning model to generate text. The first step is to pre-train the model by feeding it a large amount of text. The second step is to fine-tune the model by providing it with pairs of questions and answers. The model is then further improved by using reinforcement learning, which involves training the model to produce text that results in a positive outcome (reward).,The text describes how artificial agents can be trained to make decisions based on probabilities, in order to optimize their rewards. This technique can be used to control players in games, or to simulate processes that are difficult to express. The agents may sometimes take unusual decisions, in order to explore different options and find the best possible reward.,The text discusses how reinforcement learning can be used to fine-tune AI models, with a focus on how a reward model can be used to align the model with human expectations.,The text discusses the idea that it is now possible to create models that are much better aligned with human values, and that this could potentially lead to a future where AI is much better behaved.,The text discusses the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to be used for evil purposes. It notes that while AI models are becoming more sophisticated, they are still ultimately based on simple techniques that are reproducible and attainable.,The text describes how Lightning makes it possible to create applications that are easy to scale and that don&#39;t require a lot of platform engineers to maintain.",2023-03-27T02:19:30Z

Luca shares how he used GPT-3 to write lyrics for a song, and Josh talks about how GPT-3 could be used to generate names for a show.,The text discusses how the chatbot Chachi PT works. Chachi PT is a GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) that has been conditioned to chat. GPT is a model that is not easy to understand, but it can be written in 300 lines of python. The model is trained on a massive amount of data, and then it is fine-tuned to interact with people. The model is ranked by another model, which is trained to rank the output of the big model. This ranking is done by humans, who say which output is better than another. The ranking is then used to improve the parameters of the larger model.,The text discusses how large language models can be used to generate text, and how they are capable of learning algorithms to do so. It also notes that these models are becoming more common and that they are getting better as people learn how to use them more effectively.,The text discusses the development of quantum computing, and how it has made it possible to understand code and create algorithms that can be executed at inference time. The author also talks about the importance of diffusion in this process, and how it has led to the development of sound generation.,The text discusses the use of attention mechanisms in neural networks, and how they can be used to improve image generation. It also notes that these attention mechanisms can be expressed in a few lines, which makes them easier to understand and work with.,The text describes the Transformer architecture, which is a way of learning non-linear relationships between input and output sequences. The Transformer is efficient at learning these relationships, and this makes it a powerful tool for tasks like image recognition and text classification.,The text discusses how Arabic numerals are more efficient than Roman numerals, and how this efficiency can be used to improve neural networks and AI. It also argues that products which remove the need for conceptual boilerplate will improve people&#39;s lives.,The text discusses the idea that it is often only when we see the full context of a situation that we are able to understand it fully. This is compared to the process of translating a sentence, where it is only when we see the full sentence that we can get an accurate translation. The author suggests that the same principle can be applied to notes, and that it is only when we are done adding to them that the structure becomes apparent.",2023-03-27T15:11:54Z

Luca shares how he used GPT-3 to write lyrics for a song, and Josh talks about how GPT-3 could be used to generate names for a show.,The text discusses how the chatbot Chachi PT works. Chachi PT is a GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) that has been conditioned to chat. GPT is a model that is not easy to understand, but it can be written in 300 lines of python. The model is trained on a massive amount of data, and then it is fine-tuned to interact with people. The model is ranked by another model, which is trained to rank the output of the big model. This ranking is done by humans, who say which output is better than another. The ranking is then used to improve the parameters of the larger model.,The text discusses how large language models can be used to generate text, and how they are capable of learning algorithms to do so. It also notes that these models are becoming more common and that they are getting better as people learn how to use them more effectively.,The text discusses the development of quantum computing, and how it has made it possible to understand code and create algorithms that can be executed at inference time. The author also talks about the importance of diffusion in this process, and how it has led to the development of sound generation.,The text discusses the use of attention mechanisms in neural networks, and how they can be used to improve image generation. It also notes that these attention mechanisms can be expressed in a few lines, which makes them easier to understand and work with.,The text describes the Transformer architecture, which is a way of learning non-linear relationships between input and output sequences. The Transformer is efficient at learning these relationships, and this makes it a powerful tool for tasks like image recognition and text classification.,The text discusses how Arabic numerals are more efficient than Roman numerals, and how this efficiency can be used to improve neural networks and AI. It also argues that products which remove the need for conceptual boilerplate will improve people&#39;s lives.,The text discusses the idea that it is often only when we see the full context of a situation that we are able to understand it fully. This is compared to the process of translating a sentence, where it is only when we see the full sentence that we can get an accurate translation. The author suggests that the same principle can be applied to notes, and that it is only when we are done adding to them that the structure becomes apparent.",2023-03-27T15:11:54Z

Luca argues that while some people may be concerned that these techniques are leading to artificial intelligence that is too human-like, the reality is that they are simply providing more value than ever before. He cites the example of a person in HR who is using AI to help screen resumes, and notes that this is just one example of how AI is benefiting people in a direct way.,The text discusses the development of chatbots and how they are becoming more natural and fluent. It also mentions that there are many open source alternatives to the chatbot GPT3, which is based on scraped data.,The text describes a method for training a machine learning model to generate text. The first step is to pre-train the model by feeding it a large amount of text. The second step is to fine-tune the model by providing it with pairs of questions and answers. The model is then further improved by using reinforcement learning, which involves training the model to produce text that results in a positive outcome (reward).,The text describes how artificial agents can be trained to make decisions based on probabilities, in order to optimize their rewards. This technique can be used to control players in games, or to simulate processes that are difficult to express. The agents may sometimes take unusual decisions, in order to explore different options and find the best possible reward.,The text discusses how reinforcement learning can be used to fine-tune AI models, with a focus on how a reward model can be used to align the model with human expectations.,The text discusses the idea that it is now possible to create models that are much better aligned with human values, and that this could potentially lead to a future where AI is much better behaved.,The text discusses the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to be used for evil purposes. It notes that while AI models are becoming more sophisticated, they are still ultimately based on simple techniques that are reproducible and attainable.,The text describes how Lightning makes it possible to create applications that are easy to scale and that don&#39;t require a lot of platform engineers to maintain.",2023-03-27T02:19:30Z

This approach has been proposed as a way to avoid the need for human feedback.,The text discusses how a chatbot could be used to help customers choose their favorite pizza, and how the model could be aligned to avoid producing outputs that are abrasive or offensive. One way to do this is to use human feedback to rank the outputs, so that the model will not preferentially choose outputs that are abrasive. Another way is to prompt the model with questions like &quot;is there anything offensive in this phrase pineapple pizza sucks?&quot; to get it to identify abrasive content.,The text defines the term &quot;emergent ability&quot;, and explains how scale affects the ability of emergent abilities to show up.

Foundation models have specific challenges that come from scale, data, and the need to be evaluated on different tasks.,The text discusses the potential for prompt injection attacks on AI systems, and how these attacks could be used to extract sensitive information or cause other disasters.

Google has invested 300 million dollars in anthropic, a company that develops large language models. Microsoft has introduced Bing Chat, a chatbot that can have conversations with users and provide up-to-date references. Google&#39;s chatbot has been criticized for getting a factually incorrect answer, which caused the company&#39;s stock to drop. Microsoft, on the other hand, is perceived well despite its chatbot&#39;s weird interactions.,The text discusses the potential benefits of Google investing in anthropic technology, in light of the recent problems Microsoft has had with its chatbot. It is suggested that Google may be better equipped to deal with the issue of aligning their models, due to their experience with artificial intelligence.,The text discusses how Google&#39;s AI technology is lagging behind in comparison to other companies. Google is trying to catch up, but it is difficult because they have to meet high expectations. The author suggests that it may be helpful for Google to spin off their AI technology into a separate, independent startup.,The text discusses the idea that large language models can be used to learn algorithmic reasoning, and that once this logic is learned, it can be applied to solve problems that are not related to language. The author notes that there are many small startups that are using the open AI API to build their models, and that this is likely to multiply in the future.,The text discusses how businesses can leverage existing data and tools to create new, innovative products and services. One way to do this is by fine-tuning existing models to better fit their domain, or by prompting the model with specific domain-related questions. Another way is to reach out to external sources of information, like APIs, to get the data and knowledge they need.,The text discusses the three different ways that AI can be used to generate knowledge. The first is prompting, which involves taking the output of an AI and aligning it to a specific field. The second is training the AI on a small set of domain-specific data. The third is training the AI from scratch, which requires a large data set.,The text discusses how a proof of concept is more important than a perfect model for a startup, and how investors will be excited by a product that is flexible and allows users to be creative. The author also mentions that the cost of entry for AI startups is low, and that the biggest challenge is finding the right market for the product.,The text discusses the changing landscape of the coding industry, and how the barrier to entry for creating innovative products is lowered by the relatively easy ability to prompt models to do hard things. It encourages people to play with these models and see what they can do with them, as they have the potential to change the dynamics of the world as we know it.",2023-03-27T15:13:37Z

And, usually, each bin has the exact same width. Thus, we could calculate the probability of an event in a bin occurring by calculating the area of the rectangle associated with a bin (width times height) and dividing by the area of all the rectangles formed by all of the bins. That said, with histograms, since each bin has the exact same width, we can also calculate the probability by just using the heights of each bin, since the widths will cancel out.<br>Now, in contrast, a continuous distribution function does not have bins. Instead, we can pick any single point we want, but the width of a rectangle at that point will be 0, and thus, the probability of that point, width times height, will also be 0. This is why we don&#39;t calculate probabilities for individual points when we have a continuous distribution, but instead, calculate probabilities between two different values.

The reason the standard error is used when calculating a CI for the mean is because the SE is a measure of how much the mean value will change if we repeated the experiment a bunch of times. In contrast, the standard deviation is a measure of how much the individual data points will change if we repeated the experiment a bunch of times.

You also mentioned in the comments that if we had more measurements from one lab than the other, we can use a weighted average of the differences in the 2 labs. What if the mutant-control difference in lab A really differs from that in lab B. You can already see that in the dot plot. Would it make sense to add an offset term for the difference too as you did for the lab A control mean?<br>In this case the equation should be Y = lab A control mean + lab B offset for the mean + lab A difference + lab B offset for the difference ?",2022-10-07T10:01:14Z

The t-test can only compare means between two groups and it can only take one variable into account when making that comparison. For example, a t-test can compare the height of two groups of people, where &quot;height&quot; is the only variable we measure. However, when we have more than one variable, like we measured &quot;height&quot; and we measured &quot;weight&quot;, then we would not be able to use the t-test to compare the  two groups. In contrast, an F-test works when we have measured 1 or more variables. In other words, the F-test is a generalization of the t-test.  In these examples, we have measured more than one variable per group (size and weight) so our only choice is to use the F test (if we want to use all of the data we measured).",2022-03-28T14:01:07Z

So log(0.17) = &quot;log base e of 0.17&quot; = -1.77. The natural log (log to base &#39;e&#39;) is used because it often simplifies the mathematics that underpins statistics. That said, you can use whatever base you would like as long as you are consistent.<br>Also, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARfXDSkQf1Y&amp;t=10m00s"">10:00</a>, I say that a histogram of the log(odds) has the shape of a normal distribution, but what I should have said is that the shape is <b>similar</b> to a normal distribution and is <b>approximated</b> with a normal distribution.<br>Lastly, people often ask about how to generate the normal distribution: First, I randomly selected a number between 1 and 100 and I get 32. That means I will use 32 as the numerator for the odds. The denominator is then 100-32 = 68. Then I calculate the log(32 / 68) and get -0.75 (because I use log base &#39;e&#39;, but you can use any log base as long as you are consistent). Then I pick another random number between 1 and 100 and get 54. This means that the numerator for my odds is 54 and the denominator is 100-54 = 46. So I calculate the log(54 / 46)=0.16. Then I just repeat that process a bunch of times (100s) and draw a histogram of the log(odds) values. If I do this, I will get a normal distribution.<br><br>Support StatQuest by buying my book The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning or a Study Guide or Merch!!! <a href=""https://statquest.org/statquest-store/"">https://statquest.org/statquest-store/</a>",2022-07-11T16:28:11Z

Here&#39;s what it says:<br><br>&quot;The histogram of log(odds ratios) of two unrelated variables appearing as a normal distribution can be explained by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The Central Limit Theorem states that when independent random variables are summed or averaged, their distribution tends to approach a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original distribution, as long as certain conditions are met.<br><br>In the case of log(odds ratios) of two unrelated variables, assuming that the individual variables are independent and have finite means and variances, the CLT applies. The log(odds ratio) is a transformation applied to the individual variables, which may have their own distributions. However, when the log(odds ratios) are calculated, the values from the two variables are combined in a way that follows the principles of addition and subtraction. Since the variables are unrelated, their contributions to the log(odds ratios) are independent.<br><br>As a result, when the log(odds ratios) of two unrelated variables are calculated repeatedly and plotted in a histogram, the CLT suggests that the distribution of the log(odds ratios) will tend towards a normal distribution. This means that the histogram will exhibit the characteristic bell-shaped curve commonly associated with a normal distribution.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that the applicability of the CLT assumes a sufficiently large sample size. For small sample sizes, the normality assumption may not hold, and other factors might influence the shape of the distribution.&quot;",2023-06-14T20:40:14Z

I just have one quick question- we divide data into training and testing sets. We choose best hyperparameters and best model using n fold cross validation during training process. Result of this step is the final tuned model, NOT different models right? I mean - we never choose best model with the test set. We only use test our final model on it ( which is found using cross validation) and that&#39;s it, if the results are not good, we do not try to make it better right? As the test set is the future data and should not been used in finding best possible model. This is as I see it, correct?",2023-11-08T12:35:33Z

However, with mice and humans, there is a certain height that we can attain before we just get wider. For example, there once was someone who weighted 361kg - so much heavier than most everyone in the world, however, they were not taller than average. Even though they weighed 7 times as much as an average person, they were not 7 times taller. In fact, they were not any taller at all.

I had hard time understanding what the illustrations mean and how it works until I read that a logistic regression is essentially the linear regression with a different loss function: instead of the mean squared loss it uses the log loss, <a href=""https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression/model-training"">https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression/model-training</a>.

A tree, on the other hand, can predict 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s.",2023-11-12T23:03:53Z

I really liked the video and found most of it very intuitive, but the fact that ridge regression favours a more shallow slope is not. With a large set of predictors, it&#39;s easy to see that enforcing sparsity may provide better out-of-sample predictions in practice. But with a single predictor the prior assumption of &#39;the obsvered data tend to overestimate the influence of the predictor&#39; seems no more justified than its opposite would be. In other words: under OLS assumptions the distribution of OLS fitted slopes will be symmetrically centered on the &#39;true&#39; slope.

But I think part of the problem is that the term &quot;variance&quot; has two meanings - the statistical one ( <a href=""https://youtu.be/SzZ6GpcfoQY"">https://youtu.be/SzZ6GpcfoQY</a> ) - and the machine learning one ( <a href=""https://youtu.be/EuBBz3bI-aA"">https://youtu.be/EuBBz3bI-aA</a> ). The whole point of regularization is to reduce variation in the sense of used in machine learning (and thus, increase long term accuracy) and we do that by desensitizing the model to the variables in the model.

Thanks for your videos, especially when you are diving into details and tips.<br>In tip#2 concerning centering, you show 2 sets of 3 points and you present the centering to the mean. Let&#39;s imagine an experiment with 3 patients with drug A and 3 patients with drugs A and B. Let&#39;s say the lower/left set if the reference, drug A, and the upper/right set is the test, drug A+B. What about centering on A (set A will be at the origin)? This centering should show the total effect of adding drug B to drug A, whereas the mean centering shows half the effect. In the same vein, the variables plot should show the variables that change from drugA set to drugAB set instead of showing variables that change from the mean experiment ie ((drugA+drugAB)/2).

UgyBEILQDXMelFRhgUB4AaABAg,@buihung3704,,1,H3EjCKtlVog,3,0,2023-11-08T17:49:33Z,"Hmm the way you calculate Likelihood in this video is different from the Likelihood vs Probability video.<br>- In Likelihood vs Probability video, you calculate the Likelihood of a distribution we are assumed to have 2 characteristics (mean + S.D), GIVEN that you measure some data from that distribution. The Likelihood is used to determined the assumption is correct or not (if correct, it&#39;s the Maximum Likelihood). So Likelihood is used to find the distribution, given the measures data.<br>- In this video, you calculate the Likelihood of a continuous variable (Popcorn, Soda pop, Candy) occurs, GIVEN that the person is either Like Troll 2 or Don&#39;t Like Troll 2. In my opinion, the term Likelihood here is very similar to the term Probability that you use in Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier video, hence isn&#39;t same as Likelihood vs Probability video. Note that the distribution is fixed here.<br><br>Q1: So I guess your Likelihood = Probability in this case?<br>Q2: May I ask if Likelihood applies to continuous variables like Popcorn, Soda pop and Candy... and Probability (interchangbly with Likelihood also) applies to discrete variables like the frequency of each word in a finite set of words from in an email like Dear, Friend, Money, ... ?",2023-11-08T17:53:28Z

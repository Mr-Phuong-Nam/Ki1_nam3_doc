I&#39;m curious what depth you set it up for, I set mine for 35&quot; because that was the deepest I could go and still fit a full-length shelf in. I installed a full-length shelf at the very top and bottom, they were from Rasing Electronics and were about $55 each on Ama (still available) and can be adjusted from 30-35&quot; depth. I have seen your P2 video and the wood you put in the bottom, it was not a bad idea at all and because I know how that wood is resting in the bottom, the shelf would require a loss of space because you would be mounting it at U1. And although these shelves are steel, my top shelf has since started to sag in the middle slightly, not sure why because there&#39;s is not too much on it and the bottom one is still perfectly flat despite having 2 full desktops on it.",2023-09-30T00:01:02Z

Google can probably explain better than I can, the gist of it is that you&#39;re not supposed to max out a circuit.  So if your wall is good for 30A, you should be aiming to max at 24A and leave that 20% headroom as a safety margin.  Your PDU vendor can probably tell you for sure, but I suspect what you have is a 30A PDU that&#39;s de-rated to 24, instead of them telling you it&#39;s 30 but making you pinky-promise not to use 30.",2022-07-06T14:37:51Z

Maybe cut another narrow piece to use the full width and maybe some joining brackets or other hardware on the bottom, so it is one joined piece of wood and just paint it black. I say this because a full-depth self would have to start at 1U and you&#39;re getting a little extra space doing it the way you have here.

The most straight forward example is setting high rewards for probes mining the mineral patch up to 16, lower rewards up to 24, and no rewards at all past 24. A Starcraft player with a good basic macro keeps his resources low, so you could have some kind of a quota for production structures, something like 1 for gateway, 1.5 for stargates and robos, given fully saturated bases you could support production of 3.5-4 value production structures per base.

If this check is not performed, then randomly sampled actions will cause the snake to suddenly go from the right to the left, then collide with itself, then done = True, and return reward = -10, which may cause the model to often use -10 reward exit, may be detrimental to learning?

The reason behind this is that you become dependent on Co-Pilot for the answers and autocorrect, and many people just picking up the language can&#39;t write a single line of code without assistance. I do have real world  experience within the last 3-6 months to draw on to form this conclusion. Normally when I mentor someone, we start with IDLE, but that would be silly with the amount of content that you have put together. A full IDE such as VS Code or Pycharm is great for speed and line by line explanation and if you were to stop every few lines and continue to explain the use of the line, then you would have taken my argument away from me. In conclusion, Co-Pilot is a great tool to add to your tool box / dev environment if you are iterating over things very quickly, but is a very poor teaching / tutorial tool.",2022-02-08T01:54:52Z

For example, a high reward just for reaching a goal is inadequate. Adding additional rewarding for how efficiently the servos are used, reward for standing up more straight and using a wider range of servo motion. When a kid learns to walk, they are reinforced over time for how long they can stand, how fast they can get there, and additional tasks like reaching and overcoming obstacles for treats, etc. So can we really blame the reinforcement models when we don&#39;t even reward them for how visually appealing they are, or how efficiently they use their ranges of motion?",2022-01-18T22:53:50Z

I also have a Petoi Bittle and I&#39;m planning to start practice reinforcement learning on it as well so these videos are a life-saver. Right now I&#39;m using ROS with a raspi mounted on mine for teleoperation and other cool features but I&#39;d like to train it to make sense of it&#39;s surroundings and eventually just act on it&#39;s own (for now walking and flipping would be a start). <br><br>I see a couple of comments about calculating energy usage and how you could do it on Bittle. One thing that comes to mind is to simulate the current draw from the battery to each of the motors-basically simulate the battery on the robot as well. So for example, if motor 8 moves by 0.2, the battery discharges 0.5%. These are made up numbers as I didn&#39;t look into the exact draw of the servo motors.<br><br>The second change you could make which would benefit the simulated battery is to have a delayed reward, so instead of getting a reward after each action, you get a reward after either making it a certain distance or fully depleting the battery, and this would reset the simulation. This would encourage Bittle to not only move in a certain direction, but to also conserve energy with movements. This also alleviates your worry of over constraining the robot, and since you have the resources for training it should work just as well with the Proximal Policy.",2022-04-27T00:41:26Z

There&#39;s a secondary concern about whether it&#39;s a risk for these platforms to be in the hands of a relatively small number of companies, as it gives them a huge advantage for ML tasks and if they chose to they could really nerf a lot of work by third parties.

Depending on the testing style, often tests just test your ability to reproduce or otherwise perform on the spot. What kind of stuff is tested in these tests?<br><br>I&#39;m going to make some assumptions now which may not apply to you; I don&#39;t want to fill in what you think, so if you think I&#39;m talking rubbish that&#39;s totally fine.<br><br>You say you want your future to be in data science; cool! This may make you more anxious about the topic as in your idea of your future so much could depend on it, which may result in having difficulty studying, which in turn can lead to lower grades and more anxiety when studying the topic; an unfortunate vicious cycle.<br><br>It may help to put things in perspective; you might find that you like something else later, and your career is not completely fixed on the decisions you make now. It can take a long time to find out what profession is a good option for happiness (although I realize that many don&#39;t have the luxury to have much choice in profession). And it can change over time, and in my opinion that&#39;s OK.<br><br>Additionally, especially in some &#39;shame centric&#39; cultures (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt%E2%80%93shame%E2%80%93fear_spectrum_of_cultures)"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt%E2%80%93shame%E2%80%93fear_spectrum_of_cultures)</a>, there may be an immense pressure to strive for whatever that culture sees as a &#39;high status&#39; job at the time, as in such cultures this could reflect on your family&#39;s/social circle&#39;s esteem. Nothing particular comes to mind to tackle this, but it may be something to keep in mind when trying to get a &#39;meta&#39; view of ones situation.<br><br>Now, what makes you afraid of large swaths of code? When coding, you don&#39;t have to keep all the details of the program in your working memory; that would be quite the feat! In fact, building abstractions so you can do stuff at a higher level - without having to worry about the nitty-gritty - is a very important principle in building software.  If I&#39;m coding myself, I instead have a rough conceptual model of how things tie together, and select pieces to work on based on that. If I&#39;m working in a large codebase which I didn&#39;t build myself it can take some time to explore how things work; that&#39;s totally natural.<br><br>A large codebase in a language you don&#39;t know can be intimidating, just like a book might seem before one learns to read. I don&#39;t think this fear is grounded in a reality though; I don&#39;t think you are afraid of reading books now? Maybe making this analogy can help.<br><br>On a sidenote, although I think it is unlikely, it may be that you eventually find out that coding is just not for you. It is probably way to early to tell. But it is a possibility, and if this happens I think it is better to find out where ones potential lies, instead of forcing yourself to do something that makes you unhappy. I think this is a fine balance though, as it it is hard and subjective whether something is just &#39;not for you&#39;. I&#39;ve found myself not understanding concepts/topics, fearing I was to stupid to grasp them, only to have it &#39;click&#39; one day.<br><br>If you have the spare time, it could help to just try to build something for fun, whilst following basic tutorials and learning as you are building stuff. I still find building stuff very enjoyable. This may displace some of the fears as you&#39;ll probably find that complexity does not necessarily imply difficulty, and that coding can be very much fun!<br><br>This got way longer than I initially intended. Sorry for rambling; I hope you&#39;ll get something useful out of it.",2021-05-16T15:10:51Z

It serves as an offset or baseline value that helps neurons activate (produce output) even when the input values are all zero.<br>In simple terms, think of bias as a measure of how easy it is for a neuron to activate or fire. It allows a neuron to be responsive to inputs even if they are not very large. Without bias, the neuron might not activate unless the inputs are significantly large.<br>The bias term adds flexibility to the model. It helps the neural network account for situations where certain inputs might not be as informative but still play a role in making a prediction.",2023-11-01T04:18:27Z

How do I get the network to decide which direction to go (left or right) in a game?<br>The approach I gave about using 1 output node and then mapping its value to a result is just an example. In practice, it&#39;s more common to map 1 output node -&gt; 1 output option. So for your specific case, I would say to have two output nodes, one output node for left, and one output node for right. After providing the agent with the inputs, you should end up with two output values. You can decide which direction to go by whichever value is bigger. So for example, let&#39;s say the first node is left, and the second node is right. You feed the network your inputs, and it produces [0.2, 0.8] for left and right respectively. Since 0.8 is bigger, you interpret that as the agent deciding to go right. Keep in mind this is one way of doing it, and pretty common from what I&#39;ve seen, but you can really do anything you can come up with. I encourage you to experiment.<br><br>2. How does the network use the dataset and learn?<br>If I&#39;m understanding correctly, the first point you brought up is how the network uses the dataset. All a dataset is, is a bunch of data that has already been collected and is correct. If you are trying to train a NN as it plays a game, then you would not use a dataset. You would have it make a decision in the game, and then determine what the correct decision was. Once you know what the correct decision was, you can use that value to calculate the error, and then use backwards propagation to update all of the neurons in the network with new weights. A fantastic article that I used to learn about this is here: <a href=""https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/05/06/backpropagation-from-scratch-with-python/"">https://pyimagesearch.com/2021/05/06/backpropagation-from-scratch-with-python/</a><br>In short, the network technically does not adjust itself based on a dataset, but rather based on the error of its prediction versus what the correct value should be.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re interested in this kind of stuff, you should check out something called NEAT: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies</a><br>There&#39;s also a sick Python library for it here: <a href=""https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"">https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a><br><br>If you&#39;re training an AI to play a game, this is something you might want to look into. Essentially, instead of just adjusting weights and biases of neurons, this algorithm learns by trying to add/remove neurons, add/remove connections, etc. It&#39;s a whole different crazy approach to AI, and it is essentially just evolution but for AIs.",2022-12-19T19:39:43Z

If there a way to keep them, and increase the loss value, so that the back-propagation works harder to reduce this prediction of wrong classes, would it not be better? So basically, it works both to increase probability of right class and reduce probability of wrong class. Currently it is only increasing probability of the right class.<br><br>2) Per Luis Serrano, in article &quot;Shannon Entropy, Information Gain, and Picking Balls from Buckets&quot;, the log is base 2. He describes entropy with an example where there are two colors of balls, and hence when there are 50-50% balls, entropy is highest = 1. However, if there are 3 colors (he does not describe it, just my extension), then log 3 will have highest entropy when there are equal number of balls of each color. This is just an observation.<br><br>3) If we plot 3 graphs in GeoGebra, where X-axis is y_pred and y_axis = ln(y_pred), log2(y_pred) and log10(y_Pred) (keeping in mind that only when y_actual = 1, we multiply log of predicted to it, otherwise it is 0). So if our prediction for a correct class was close to 1, e.g. 0.9, then -log10(y_pred=0.9) has the lowest value (lowest loss), -log2(y_pred=0.9) has the highest. [-log10(0.9)=0.046, -ln(0.9)=.0105, -ln2(0.9)=0.152). This would make me believe that log2 is aggressive in showing higher losses for same y_pred. The lower the base, the more aggressive the loss function becomes (try out log1.1(y_pred) for eg). There is no end to decreasing the value of this base, tending to 1 but not equal to 1. I guess we need to stop somewhere. In a similar vein, log10 is much less aggressive, so it may take longer time to reach same levels of loss errors.",2023-03-10T08:11:12Z

Which is totally different from the quantum superposition: indeed whenever u got a PURE STATE (totally quantum mechanical superposition) the state vector points the surface of the Bloch sphere!<br>¬†<br>I&#39;ll try to explain the case in which  Hadamard applied to a qubit and then the cnot to the other one:¬†<br>Hadamard takes a ket(0) pure state and gives a superposition of ket(0) and ket(1) with same amplitude. This is still a pure state. Than the cnot entangles the two qubits BUT unknowing the result of a measurement on the first qubit. And here comes the so called &quot;statistically mixed&quot; state: now there is 50%50% chance for both qubits of being on ket[0] or ket[1]. <br><br>It&#39;s veryveryvery instructive to try and measure the first qubit BEFORE the cnot entanglement, this should give again a pure state.<br>Analogous argument applies for the rest of the examples on the video.

If you create a 3 Qubit circuit, with nothing on q0 and q1, and X on q2, then you will have 100% of chance to get |100&gt; and 0% of chance to get |001&gt;... WHY ? the reason is simple : put the following : 0x2^0 (q0) + 0x2^1 (q1) + 1x2^2 (q2) = 4 = 100b... So 100% on |100&gt;... I know it&#39;s a bit confusing at the beginning, but you must read Qubits from bottom to top. So in you example : |000&gt;, |001&gt;, |010&gt; and |111&gt; are the good final states.

In general, you actually want to sample much faster than the Nyquist rate to have a good representation of your signal. There is actually another equation that describes your measurement error based on your oversampling rate (I forget what that equation is called right now). The general rule of thumb we use in our industry is 10X oversampling rate, and anything less than 5X oversampling is regarded as too inaccurate for measurement purposes. If you look at the jupyter notebook code that you showed in the video, they are also only using data up to ~fs/6, or 6X oversampling <a href=""http://ratio.you/"">ratio.You</a> can see this in the frequency band limit they defined for gamma waves. <br><br><br>Long story short, your system with 16 channels at 125Hz is really only good up to frequencies of ~25Hz.

Therefore I postulate using drastically different thoughts to MEAN &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; may lead to better results.

I really love your enthusiasm, thanks for making this series.<br><br><br>I really want to point you to an issue you seem to not be addressing: What mental function is caused by (or causes) what brain activity? And crucially for an EEG BCI, can that particular mental-function-brain-activity pairing be classified?<br><br><br>Thinking the word &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; is not necessarily caused by (or causes) brain activity that is distinguishable by man or machine learning algorithm SPECIFICALLY using EEG. In the case of imagined speech or inner speech, the brain activity that matters is, perhaps, beyond your reach. By all means, continue trying  - if you find a way to make it work, the world would love to know!<br><br><br>However, you should be aware that researchers have identified a few certain mental-function-brain-activity pairings that do work well for EEG BCIs. Please look into &quot;motor imagery BCIs.&quot; When you imagine a certain body part to be moved, a certain spot on your motor cortex engages a specific brain activity pattern (called Event-Related Desychonization [ERD], in mu and beta bands). Amazingly, a different imagined body part movement will cause the same type of brain activity, but in a different location of the motor cortex. Therefore, imagining right-hand motor imagery will cause a very DISTINGUISHABLE signal from left-hand motor imagery - different electrode channels showing different amounts of ERD you will find in the FFT of the data. Here&#39;s a literature review on this topic, I could send more papers if you want: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232268/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6232268/</a><br><br><br>Best of luck!

Maybe if we found certain thoughts that the ai found easy to predict we could use them as a way of triggering left or right. Basically test different thoughts and see what is most easily detectable and substitute them for actually thinking left or right. Use an ai to find the most effective thoughts and label each thought.<br><br>like making a mental language.,2020-12-29T04:03:35Z

To capture EMG, you would need EMG electrodes on your arm to capture the electrical activity of muscles moving your arm.  This electrical activity is not recorded by the EEG (maybe only the intention or signal coming from the brain telling the arm to move, but that is not EMG).  Your heart beats regularly (I hope), yet an EEG does not capture EKG data.  To do that, you need electrodes positioned close to the heart, or on both arms.  Moving your eyes or blinking your eyelids will give rise to some EMG artifacts, as these muscles are close enough to the electrodes on your head to be picked up (and also the fact that the EMG signal is much stronger than the EEG one).  Hope this clarifies things a bit.  What you are saying about EMG doesn&#39;t make sense.  Thanks for sharing your code and data!",2019-11-17T19:34:32Z

Great videos, it&#39;s nice to see someone confident, knows what they&#39;re doing and is a natural teacher. It feels like you&#39;re primarily did it to share your knowledge and made videos because that supported the main goal. Sounds silly but there&#39;s a lot of guff on YouTube that is first and foremost a video to watch<br><br>Some feedback though, code review style:<br><br>You should have explained what that 1 was all about. Everything else made perfect sense, but hand-waving over that sorta left me with a gap where I was getting distracted thinking about wtf it meant and had to rewind. In fact it&#39;s still bugging me. Gonna have to look it up.<br><br>The powers of two thing is &#39;cause everything is transistors and 0 or 1. So they&#39;re even numbers, they align nicely with memory, are faster with less waste etc.<br><br>Grumbling about magic numbers in other people&#39;s code, then putting them in yours.. tsk tsk. Would have been better to make width and height variables to encourage this new generation of ML barbarians to give things decent names.<br><br>Could have explained that &quot;rectified linear&quot; is just &quot;floor(0)&quot;, had to look it up and frowned at the whole of mathematics for their hyperpathalogical superfluoustic jargonization. The stuff about scaling the outputs kinda lost both of us too.<br><br>Finally, religious issue: embrace functional! You get the view vs reshape thing, but overwrite variables and prefer classes with mutable state. Functions are much cleaner other than passing parameters, better to test, easier to reuse. Might cut down on the copypasta in the AI world if people are reusing functions.<br><br>Great vids though like I said, pace is great, feels natural and the plot thing and your efficiency almost made me <b>want</b> to use a jupyter notebook as my interpreter.

What I would prefer is not an explanation where that number comes from but maybe just automatically do the flattening all together. Then again it really depends on you input.

Here, it boils down to:<br>128 * [50 - 4 / 2 - 4 / 2 - 4 / 2]^2 = 128 * 2 * 2,<br>where 128 is the number of output channels, 50 is the input size, / denotes floor division and the operations in the brackets are written in order from left to right for readability.<br>I will now try to explain, how I came up with this formula:<br>The first thing we need to regard is the input size. Here, we have a 50x50 image. This is our starting point, the size of the resulting feature maps will (usually) never exceed the input size.<br>The next important parameter is the kernel size of the convolutional layers. For this tutorial, you used a 5 by 5 kernel. (To understand how it will affect the input layer, you must regard other parameters like kernel stride etc., but since you used the default values, I won&#39;t explain them here) The kernel will convolute a 5x5 grid into a new value, then move to the next position, until the whole input image is processed into a so-called &quot;feature map&quot;. So, how big is this feature map? Because the kernel operates on a 5x5 grid, it will start with its center aligned on pixel index index (2, 2) (index ranging from 0 to 49) and end on pixel index (47, 47). Therefore, there is a 2 pixel margin on each side, which is &quot;lost&quot; in the feature map. The resulting feature map is 2 pixels smaller than the input image on each side, resulting in a size of 46*46. I don&#39;t know if my explanation is good enough, for anyone wondering, try to find some visualizations of convolutional neural networks, it really helps to understand how they operate.<br>The next step is maxpooling. Here, we use a 2x2 kernel. Effectively, this means that the size of our feature maps will be halved, leaving us with a 23*23 feature map. However, this was only the first convolutional layer!<br>So, let&#39;s repeat this calculation twice:<br>Second Layer: (23, 23) - (4, 4) = (19, 19), (19, 19) / 2= (9, 9)<br>Third Layer: (9, 9) - (4, 4) = (5, 5), (5, 5) / 2 = (2, 2)<br>Finally, we have to multiply the size of the feature map with the number of output channels of the final convolutional layer, which is 128.",2022-07-04T10:05:15Z

Essentially what&#39;s happening is we have already decided to parse the observation values into 20 discrete buckets between the highest and lowest possible. The discrete_os_window_size is the step between each bucket value. By subtracting (state - env.observation_space.low) we get some value between the high and low. Then, by dividing out discrete_os_window_size , we get the i&#39;th bucket the observation falls into. By returning .astype(np.int) it can be used as an index for the q_table.

Thinking of grid like a chess board with light and dark squares when food and player are on opposite colors the agent needs to hit the wall then do a search. So its a two step problem: hit the wall once and then search for food. But the first step is happening quickly because of the drift.  This will help learning. The q-values will be significantly higher for states when food and player are same color squares so I imagine it gets there quickly and because of the value differences.<br>You could also think of the state space as being 50 states where player and food are on same colour and 50 states where player and food on different colors.  In other words, there is one state space where there is a food item and another state space where there isn&#39;t any food.  The drift term ensures frequent transitions between these two state spaces so I imagine it will learn quite quickly the food state is more valuable than the non-food state and you&#39;ll have a positive slope for q-values towards the state with the food item.<br>  <br>I",2021-09-14T15:25:24Z

The reason for BGR is because C arrays (pyhon is written in C) is row major NCHW (number of images, channels, height width). Many vector operations packages (BLAS, etc.) are optimized for row major arrays. Since `opencv` is an image processing library, and we want it to perform image operations fast, it is BGR. For the same reasons, numpy is row major. Hence, if you read the shape tuple of a numpy array, the outermost array (i.e. &quot;the container&quot;) is the left-most dimension. Dimensions go right to left as columns, height, depth, etc. In image space, the origin is the upper left corner and y points down, so you&#39;ll have to take that into consideration as well. Also, you access numpy arrays as &quot;A[x,y,z, etc.]&quot;, not &quot;A[x][y][z]&quot;. That latter is used for lists. One last note is you could have overloaded &quot;__eq__&quot; as well to determine when two Blobjects are equal since you went to the trouble of creating a class.",2020-09-11T08:02:56Z

So for example correct usage would have been setInterval(blob, 300);<br>Which means you are passing an actual function, not a call to it. <br>Now you are faced with a problem, how do you specify the arguments to that functions?<br>- Option A: You create an anonymous function (what you called a throwaway function), which the setInterval calls without paramaters, which then calls blob with paramaters.<br>- Option B: setInterval actually takes more paramaters than the first 2. Any paramater you specify after the interval time in miliseconds, will be passed as a paramater to the function. i.e.:<br>setInterval(blob, 300, x, y,  20, &quot;green&quot;);<br>is equivalent to<br>setInterval(function(){<br>blob(x, y, 20, &quot;green&quot;);<br>}, 300);",2019-05-18T16:29:56Z

Only a couple comments about this video:   1.  Definitely don&#39;t like the &quot;magic number&quot; 40 for the enter key.     2.  when you added the resizing adjustments and copied code to update_chat_history_layout, you should have modified the original code to call the new function (so future changes are in only one place)  3. Using Clock.schedule_once() instead of a direct call allows all the kivy events to be processed before the call is made, because events need to be processed so state is updated.

When you create a socket, you have to specify its address family, and then you can only use addresses of that type with the socket. The Linux kernel, for example, supports 29 other address families such as UNIX (AF_UNIX) sockets and IPX (AF_IPX), and also communications with IRDA and Bluetooth (AF_IRDA and AF_BLUETOOTH, but it is doubtful you&#39;ll use these at such a low level).<br><br>For the most part, sticking with AF_INET for socket programming over a network is the safest option. There is also AF_INET6 for Internet Protocol v6 addresses.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Share<br>Improve this answer<br>Follow<br>edited Nov 17, 2021 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbfe3-v7yE0&amp;t=0m02s"">0:02</a><br>Gabriel Staples&#39;s user avatar<br>Gabriel Staples<br>27.5k99 gold badges149149 silver badges202202 bronze badges<br>answered Oct 20, 2009 at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbfe3-v7yE0&amp;t=11m46s"">11:46</a><br>George Shore&#39;s user avatar<br>George Shore",2022-11-24T22:08:55Z

It should never be used when the source of the data is not known, for example on a server that can be connected to by people other than you. It can be used under certain circumstances, but if you only know one way to serialise data in python it shouldn&#39;t be pickle. Pickle is very powerful and convenient but that convenience comes with a price WRT security which is laid out in the documentation. JSON (if you don&#39;t do something stupid like use eval to parse it,) Protobufs, flatbuffers and the struct module are all better options. <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html"">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html</a>",2020-08-23T03:35:48Z

Nobody else in the world has the same public IP.<br><br>On rare occasions your ISP might change it since they are responsible for assigning and maintaining a certain block of IPs. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it changing on you, though and even if it does it wont really affect anything for you if you follow good practice and actually grab the public IP from python dynamically instead of feeding it into your program as a constant yourself. Again, for small projects like this I wouldn&#39;t worry about this unless you&#39;re really paranoid.<br><br>If you want to route traffic to your server step 1) is to use static addressing so the local IP doesn&#39;t change on you. Plenty of videos on YouTube will show you how to configure this on any device. Step 2) is to figure out your routers local IP so you can configure it in your browser. Step 3) is configure your router so that any data coming into your network over the port your server is listening on is redirected over to your server. Again, lots of videos on this since most routers have pretty similar interfaces.<br><br>Again, read more about the basics of networking! This will sound like super easy stuff if you familiarize yourself. Anyways, hope this helped get you started on the right track.",2021-05-10T13:50:41Z

By doing this your graph becomes more smooth. This is why in the dataframe if you add a column named &#39;price25ma&#39; you see NaN value for first 24 items because you gave n=25 to calculate the mean. <br>I hope I could explain, I am also new to these stuff.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge about Python, ML, AI, etc.  At ~<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGeQqGd6LPc&amp;t=15m50s"">15:50</a> in this video, you start filtering your unemployment DF for February 2015.  It appears that, rather than being arbitrary, you inadvertently thought that Feb-2015 is the latest month and year of unemployment rate data.  If so, you&#39;re mistaken.  If you further explore the unemployment data, you&#39;ll find that unemployment rates are available all the way through December 2016.  Given the presidential election politics in the US (and in any country for that matter), the unemployment rates and resulting public sentiment become most relevant/influential just before such important elections.  Therefore, a better example would have explored the correlation/covariance between the county-wise unemployment rates and the voting data as of October/November 2016.  Just to be sure, I do understand that your intent was just to show how one could find some correlation between seemingly disparate data.  Of course, the actual conclusions/interpretations from such analysis are subject to personal opinions.  Admittedly, in the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s the data frames - not the specific time frames - that matter.  Cheers!",2020-09-21T02:09:08Z

You don&#39;t need to delete the db.sqlite3 file. All you have to do is first, migrate back to your previous migration that was successful. In the migrations folder, you can see the migrations you&#39;ve created. Pick the most recent one that was successful for you and do: python <a href=""http://manage.py/"">manage.py</a> migrate xxxx where xxxx is the number of the migration. This puts the database back into the state it was last running in and DOESN&#39;T DELETE the data you had in it while that migration was successful.<br><br>Now onto the models themselves. Evidently there&#39;s been some change that makes it to where we can&#39;t migrate like SentDex did. Instead, we have to take it step by step starting with the table that has zero dependencies. Which in this case will be Tutorial Category. Create the class just as he does in <a href=""http://models.py/"">models.py</a>. Now create a migration and migrate. Because there are no dependencies this will work. Also go into <a href=""http://admin.py/"">admin.py</a> and, and register Tutorial Category. Once this is done, login to the admin webpage and manually create a Tutorial Category just as he does.<br><br>Now, we can go back and create the Tutorial Class like he does in models. Once again. Makemigrations, migrate, register in admin. Run the server and go to the admin page and add a Tutorial Series manually using the same information he does, but in the same method you did for creating a category. Trying to create it just like SentDex WON&#39;T work yet. When you go to create the series, you&#39;ll notice you already have the category filled in. THIS is the one you created and is the default (because we set pk=1).<br><br>With a category and series created, finally go into the Tutorial class itself and make the final changes like sentdex adding the tutorial_series to the class as a foreign key. The default foreign key will now work, because a series already exists. When you go back into the admin page, you&#39;ll see that now your tutorials that were already created have a series. The one you created, which is now the default.",2022-07-29T16:17:59Z

Moreover, the default given for the foreign keys to use don&#39;t actually exist yet.<br><br>You do not need to delete everything in the migrations folder. You do not need to delete the db.sqlite3 file. All you have to do is first, migrate back to your previous migration that was successful. In the migrations folder, you can see the migrations you&#39;ve created. Pick the most recent one that was successful for you and do: python <a href=""http://manage.py/"">manage.py</a> migrate xxxx where xxxx is the number of the migration. This puts the database back into the state it was last running in and DOESN&#39;T DELETE the data you had in it while that migration was successful.<br><br>Now onto the models themselves. Evidently there&#39;s been some change that makes it to where we can&#39;t migrate like SentDex did. Instead, we have to take it step by step starting with the table that has zero dependencies. Which in this case will be Tutorial Category. Create the class just as he does in <a href=""http://models.py/"">models.py</a>. Now create a migration and migrate. Because there are no dependencies this will work. Also go into <a href=""http://admin.py/"">admin.py</a> and register Tutorial Category. Once this is done, login to the admin webpage and manually create a Tutorial Category just as he does.<br><br>Now, we can go back and create the Tutorial Series Class like he does in models. Once again. Makemigrations, migrate, register in admin. Run the server and go to the admin page and add a Tutorial Series manually using the same information he does, but in the same method you did for creating a category. Trying to create it just like SentDex WON&#39;T work yet. When you go to create the series, you&#39;ll notice you already have the category filled in. THIS is the one you created and is the default (because we set pk=1).<br><br>With a category and series created, finally go into the Tutorial class itself and make the final changes like sentdex adding the tutorial_series to the class as a foreign key. The default foreign key will now work, because a series already exists. When you go back into the admin page, you&#39;ll see that now your tutorials that were already created have a series. The one you created, which is now the default.",2022-07-29T16:24:36Z

You will be presented with files that are your migrations.

I get something like syntax error on mysite.conf file. I handled it by deleting red blank lines in that config file and after that using sudo a2enmod wsgi command. Then, the website was worked on server but this time, there was some other problem about static files. Respectively, &#39;chgrp -R www-data /blog/media/&#39; and &#39;chmod -R g+w  /blog/media/&#39; commands worked for my own project. By the way ,these previous commands are about writing and some other permissions. After that, the only problem was image loading. I mean , images was display on dev. tool but on the page that field was blank.  I solved it by editing some lines in <a href=""http://settings.py/"">settings.py</a> and <a href=""http://urls.py/"">urls.py</a> files.

Things like that show me that I&#39;m learning from someone who actually knows how to use a computer.

Looks like I will really enjoy it.<br><br> I am constantly on the lookout for good tutorials as a beginner to programming. One thing I have found interesting on many programming tutorials is that the person doing the teaching may use words that an absolute beginner may not know. For example if someone has never programmed before at all they may not know what a string is, or a variable or really anything at all about things that are absolutely basic to someone who has done it a while. <br><br>I work in mechanical engineering and I often have to keep myself grounded and humble when I meet someone who is completely new to the field. For example I cant expect someone to know how to undo a screw without knowing what a screw and the different types of screwdrivers there are. That is an extreme scenario but something I see a lot is that people forget what it is like to know nothing and be completely new to a subject. <br><br><br>Love your stuff so far will happily keep watching.",2021-12-21T06:00:03Z

My output is displaying slightly different from yours.  The ‚Äúprint(count, row)‚Äù code in the last line results in an output that includes the parentheses both before and after each row of the game board as well as an unwanted comma displayed after the row count.  Like this:<br><br>       a  b c<br>(0, [0, 0, 0])<br>(1, [0, 0, 0])<br>(2, [0, 0, 0])<br><br>I proceeded to change the last code line to be ‚Äúprint count, row‚Äù - by just removing the parentheses in that line of code.  When I do this, the word ‚Äúprint‚Äù changes from light blue to pink in color.  Then output works, and the parentheses before and after each row in the game board are now gone (so the display now matches what is in the video tutorial).  What is going on here?  Should I continue to leave the last code line as I have it now, or will this mess something up in future modules of this tutorial?  Alternatively, I could leave the code to match yours exactly and just accept the parentheses showing up on the game board output.<br><br>I suspect this is do to some setting/issue with Sublime Text as when I run the script as I have it (without the parentheses in the line of last line of code) in Xubuntu Xfce‚Äôs terminal,  I get an error message asking if I had meant for the parentheses to be there.  So, I went back to the ‚Äútutorial2.py‚Äù code and changed it back to how you have demonstrated in the tutorial.  When I then run the program in terminal with python3, it displays just as a you had intended.  Is there a setting in Sublime I need to change?<br><br>Thanks.",2020-04-12T21:33:56Z

I had the same question and spent like 15 mins trying to read the comments to see if anyone answered it. lets break it down. for row in game: print (&quot;row&quot;) will print out the rows that are a bunch of zeros. However, we want to label the row right? So he shows us a basic label, and calls each row 0 as well. To do that, he uses print(count,row&quot; so that for each row, it first prints the count and then the row, in game...the count is defined as zero at the top, and the row is just the list of zeros...",2022-06-04T18:50:56Z

So in that line &lt; for (count, row) in enumerate(game): &gt;, the (count, row) is just a tuple that contains a count and a row in that list of tuples that enumerate(game) returns to us. The reason sentdex could write &lt; for count, row in enumerate(game): &gt; without the parentheses is because you can declare a tuple with or without parentheses. It&#39;s just how the syntax work.<br><br><br>If you try removing the count from that for loop line, so: <br>for row in enumerate(game):<br>    print(row)<br>That would print out:<br>(0, [0, 0, 0])<br>(1, [0, 0, 0])<br>(2, [0, 0, 0])<br>which is close to what we want, but has a pair of parentheses outside each row. The reason is because since we are only giving one variable for each row in each of the element of the list, each &#39;row&#39; in this case is a tuple (a tuple that contains the &#39;count&#39; and the original &#39;row&#39;)",2020-04-23T10:40:27Z

For instance you might know now how to order strings that represent words or sentences in English, but how do you sort strings in Mandarin Chinese? How about objects of an arbitrary user defined type?<br><br><br>Why should you even care about the specific rules of Chinese phrases or other weird and arbitrary objects when you write a simple sort function? On the other hand you don&#39;t want to limit yourself to sorting only the things you already know about, and even sorting say three known different sorts of thing things would mean you have to write 3 different functions that vary in how they compare objects.<br><br><br>So why not say when you write the sort function that at the moment you don&#39;t actually  care about any specific rules for comparison, but instead let the caller of your sort worry about when they make the call?<br><br>You know that for the idea of &quot;sort&quot; to make sense at all, you need to be able to say whether given two objects whether they are in correct sorted order already or whether the first needs to be moved so it is after the second. If you are talking about an ascending sort that sounds like a &quot;greater than&quot; function, so you might go with that name, but really it&#39;s arbitrary what you call it, you could even pass it a function that does a less than if you want it to do a descending sort instead of an ascending one.<br><br><br>The general technique that allows this is called &quot;first class functions&quot;, and a particular language is said to either support or not support first class functions. What it means is that you can treat functions just like you do any other value in the language, like strings or numbers or user defined types or whatnot. That is you can store them, change them, pass them to functions, etc. just like you could with a number string or user defined type.<br><br><br>It&#39;s a little more complicated than that though, for instance C doesn&#39;t support first class functions exactly, but it can do a similar thing by storing a pointer to a function and &quot;following&quot; or dereferencing that pointer in the call to the function pointed to.",2019-02-24T09:22:40Z

But what happens is it leads to random tangents. It happens at least a few times a video and these are short videos. So say you spend a literal minute on the random tangent that you state we &quot;don&#39;t need to know yet&quot; as your saying it. After you do this 3 or 4 times in 12 minute video 1/3 of the video becomes irrelevant information that only leads to confusion. When your learning something new you only get so many &quot;spoons&quot; a day. The spoons are too valuable to be spent on information not currently needed for today&#39;s learning. I think you would really benefit from working out a flow chart for the vid and then forcing yourself to stick to it or edit out whatever isn&#39;t needed. Like writing clean code. <br><br>All in all tho I appreciate you taking the time. Its awesome of you. Being able to teach others clearly and concisely is a skill in itself that does take developing.

If your boss is so insane to make a tick-tack-toe game with rows that have different number of cols then you might as well present him with your 2 weeks notice... so back on track, all you have to do is check the len of the first row, which is len(game[0]) which will return 3 in our 3x6 case.",2020-07-27T21:14:13Z

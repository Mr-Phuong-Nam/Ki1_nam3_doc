The only hang up for me at the moment is using the same Vue app for multiple instances of essentially the same &quot;object&quot; on a webpage. For instance: Having a ListView in Django that displays multiple blog posts per page, with the body of their text being truncated to say 30 words and using Vue to expand the post body upon clicking.<br><br>What I&#39;ve had to do so far to work around this is use the {% for %} tag in my Django template and create a unique Vue app per blog post on the page. Which because I&#39;m only showing 3 per page using pagination, doesn&#39;t have a noticeable performance impact, but seems hacky and like it may be a problem down the line.<br><br>Thus far I have not a found a concrete answer for using multiple instances of the same &quot;app&quot; in Vue across multiple elements.

Unfortunately neither of your snake variations run in my Windows 10 &quot;terminal&quot; (command prompt) with Python 3.10.7. When I run the &quot;you&#39;re the food&quot; variation, immediately upon pressing an arrow key on the keyboard, I get &quot;woah you won!! how did you do it?!&quot; without seeing any of the &quot;graphics&quot; (actually saw nothing) on screen or playing at all. With your &quot;standard&quot; snake game, upon starting it and pressing an arrow key, I get:<br><br>score: 1 - speed: 3.2<br>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>  File &quot;C:\Users\user1\coding\py\csdojo\<a href=""http://snake-terminal-blessed.py/"">snake-terminal-blessed.py</a>&quot;, line 91, in &lt;module&gt;<br>    heading = world[head[0]][head[1]]<br>IndexError: list index out of range<br><br>Any ideas about what might be causing these problems and if/how I could try to fix them? And... would you consider sharing your curses version of the snake game, so new Python learners like me could see how the code differs between using curses vs blessed?<br><br>Edit: Apparently my Windows 10 command prompt can not display the unicode characters you used in the code to display the borders, snake and food... so it just displays nothing and gets confused. I simply replaced the special characters with regular ASCII characters in your variables BORDER = &#39;#&#39;<br>BODY = &#39;O&#39;<br>SPACE = &#39; &#39;<br>APPLE = &#39;*&#39;<br><br>and it works... then I tried my luck in replacing the BORDER character with a unicode block character &#39;\u2593&#39; and that also works fine. So I will experiment more with which characters Windows 10 can and can not display in the command line, to &quot;upgrade&quot; the &quot;graphics&quot; somewhat from plain ASCII :D",2022-10-11T16:21:17Z

It uses __future__.annotations to allow the Node class init to type hint itself, and typing.Any to type hint Anything for the data attribute. The program at the bottom generates both a list of nodes, wherein each appended node also becomes the next_node attribute of the most recently appended node. So, you can access the nodes by iterating through the list or by recursively accessing next_node attribute. I felt it was in the spirit of linked-lists to do recursion. I used a list to &quot;collect&quot; the nodes on a flat level because, if I hadn&#39;t, I don&#39;t know how I would add a  node to the next_node element at the end of the list. Like, I&#39;d have to make a function to recursively run through the linked-list from head every time until it found a null next_node and then create the new node there? That sounds super inefficient. I&#39;d much rather have them collected in a flat list like this, but maybe I&#39;m not understanding their use quite yet.<br><br>####################################################<br># Start of program<br># Python 3.11 code, all base packages<br>####################################################<br><br>from <i>_future_</i> import annotations<br>from typing import Any<br><br>class Node:<br>    def __init__(self, data : Any, next_node : Node = None ) -&gt; None:<br>        <a href=""http://self.data/"">self.data</a> = data<br>        self.next_node = next_node<br><br>    def __str__(self) -&gt; str:<br>        return f&quot;node:: data: {self.data}, next_node: ||{self.next_node}&quot;<br><br>def count_nodes(head : Node) -&gt; int:<br>    count = 1<br>    iter_node = head<br><br>    while iter_node.next_node._<i>class_</i> == Node:<br>        count += 1<br>        iter_node = iter_node.next_node<br><br>    return count<br><br>if <i>_name_</i> == &quot;__main__&quot;:<br><br>    import random<br><br>    head_node : Node = Node(data=&quot;CS Dojo is the first beer&quot;)<br><br>    nodes_list : list[Node] = [head_node]<br><br>    for i in nodes_list:<br>        print(i)<br><br>    for i in range(random.randint(1,6)):<br>        new_node = Node(data=f&quot;{i+2} bottles of beer on the wall&quot;) # +2 because this is the second node in the linked-list<br>        nodes_list[-1].next_node = new_node<br>        nodes_list.append(new_node)<br><br>    print(f&quot;There are {count_nodes(head_node)} many nodes this time\n&quot;)<br><br>    for n in nodes_list:<br>        print(n,&quot;\n&quot;)<br><br>####################################################<br># End of program<br>####################################################<br><br>Here&#39;s an example of the output from running this:<br><br>There are 4 many nodes this time<br><br>node:: data: CS Dojo is the first beer next_node: ||node:: data: 2 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||node:: data: 3 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||node:: data: 4 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||None<br><br>node:: data: 2 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||node:: data: 3 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||node:: data: 4 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||None<br><br>node:: data: 3 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||node:: data: 4 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||None<br><br>node:: data: 4 bottles of beer on the wall, next_node: ||None<br><br>########### EDIT: After seeing your solution I changed a line of my code. It used to check while iter_node.next_node is not None:, but it occurred to me that the next_node attribute - being dangerous Python - could be an int or whatever.

When i am taking coding questions, i am stuck with representation of  converting problem into coding representation. i can think of my solution. but i start to write code. i am stuck with how we represent the problem as array or make list of some classes with properties like that. can u help me to resolve this.<br><br>Please find the problem and i started to solve this problem. where i am making mistakes. <br><br><br><br><br>Merging bubbles<br>Alice is playing with bubbles. She is standing at point (0, 0) and has created N bubbles. Each bubble can be characterized by there parameters:<br><br>v: denoting the size of the bubble<br>x: denoting the x coordinate of the bubble<br>y: denoting the y coordinate of the bubble<br>The following process will take place as long as there are two or more bubbles left:<br><br>Alice will choose the bubble closest to her (in case there are multiple options for a bubble she will choose the largest one among them). (Note: Here distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to <br>After choosing the first bubble, similarly, she will choose the second bubble from the bubbles left.<br>Let the two bubbles chosen have parameters as [ v1, x1, y1 ] (first bubble) and [ v2, x2, y2 ] (second bubble) respectively .<br>She will merge the two bubbles chosen and a new bubble with parameters [ v1+v2, x1 - x2, y1 - y2 ] will be formed.<br>You are given array Arr containing the characteristics of the N bubbles.<br><br>Task<br><br>Determine the coordinates of the last bubble left after the process ends.<br><br>Notes<br><br>Assume 1-based indexing.<br>There could be multiple bubbles at the same point.<br>Explanation<br><br>Assumptions<br><br>N = 4<br>Arr = [ [9,1,0] , [4,9,0] , [12,0,1], [15,4,0] ]<br>Approach<br><br>There are two bubbles closest to Alice: [9, 1, 0] and [12, 0, 1] and among these the larger bubble (i.e [12, 0, 1] ) is choosen as the first bubble, So [9, 1, 0] will be choosen as the second bubble. The new bubble formed after merging these two bubbles is [21, -1, 1]. The new array of bubbles will be [ [4, 9, 0] , [15, 4, 0] , [21, -1, 1] ].<br>Now, the bubbles [21, -1, 1] and [15, 4, 0] will be chosen and the new resulting bubble will be [36, -5, 1].<br>Finally, bubbles [36, -5, 1] and [4, 9, 0] are chosen and the new bubble formed will be [40, -14, 1].<br>Now there is only one bubble left at coordinates (-14, 1) and this is the answer.<br>Function description<br><br>Complete the function solve provided in the editor.

Any number can be added to extend the tree by one. Let&#39;s say we add a node at the top with a value of 1, now the summation will run the exact same way, but then tunnel upward one more level to the root value 1. There is one more computation done. Thus O(n) time complexity.<br><br>However in other situations, when you add a value to the tree it by design propagates outward. It creates an entire duplicate tree underneath it. An example is the Fibonacci sequence. Adding a value at the top means mirroring the entire tree underneath.

I&#39;ve experimented that we don&#39;t need to &quot;print&quot; our function when we call it to get the &quot;return value&quot;, instead, we can simply replace the &quot;return&quot; statement with &quot;print()&quot; and then call our function, without printing it.

So for example, the integer value of the first iteration of range(3) will be 0, but for range(1, 4), it will be 1. I hope that makes sense. In other words, the integer value of the iteration of the for loop is dependent on the array (list, range etc.) it&#39;s iterating through, it literally gets the value from the array.",2022-02-20T13:38:14Z

The only possibility to occure part which can be decoded in 2 ways (ex &quot;12&quot;)  is when we have 1 or 2 in the str . So if the program see &quot;1&quot; automatically it will ad up 1 to the counter. And if it sees the 2 and the next digit is at most 6 it will add one ass well. The counter represenst here the anount of pairs which can be translated in two ways. Therefore the final answerr will be just 2 rised to the counter.

Check the empty and 0 first character bits. If not, then call a helper with start and end indices or iterators. Then it just loops. On each round, while it still has input, it knows one character is always good, so add 1 to return. If there&#39;s another available, it looks at the value of the first one. If it&#39;s 1, then the next character has to be valid. If it&#39;s 2, then the next character is valid if less than 7. So in those cases move up and add another 1 to the return. Now you are on the next character and just repeat until out of data. On each round you add 1 or 2 to the return value and move up 1 or 2 positions.

However during an interview it seems like since we went to talk about flexibility and scalability and other concepts from a system hearing perspective you might want to consider a hash map instead of a hash set just so that you can consider flexibility or scalability in the future because in the future you might want to know the actual number of frequencies for each duplicate so if I solved this question using a hash map without approach would that look good or bad? It doesn&#39;t add anything to time complexity and yes there is a trade-off by adding additional space complexity but it does allow for more flexibility,2022-05-04T13:09:56Z

Most of my interviews were things you covered and your videos are also the right amount of time. It&#39;s short enough to maintain interest and long enough to give you thoroughly.  It&#39;s kind of a shame that people will only really tune in during interviews or when they are learning CS/DS.  You structured it well with depth and breadth. You go into a great overview and then have videos that go into more specific which is WAY better than having one long video. I wish I saw these videos before just doing a bunch of leetcode problems. It&#39;s a great clean organized way of explaining the tools. I didn&#39;t know how many leetcode problems were enough but this is great! I used your info so much on interviews.

I have a physics degree went into DS/ML like most of us do and now I&#39;m switching to CS. Your videos are so clear cut your speech is impeccable, perfect pace,  sound and visual, and a nice flow. I can tell you did multiple takes or practice (if not that&#39;s REALLY impressive). combined with all you have a great knowledge base and present it *flawlessly*. Most of my interviews were things you covered and your videos are also the right amount of time. It&#39;s short enough to maintain interest and long enough to give you thoroughly.  It&#39;s kind of a shame that people will only really tune in during interviews or when they are learning CS/DS.  You structured it well with depth and breadth. You go into a great overview and then have videos that go into more specific which is WAY better than having one long video. I wish I saw these videos before just doing a bunch of leetcode problems. It&#39;s a great clean organized way of explaining the tools. I didn&#39;t know how many leetcode problems were enough but this is great! I used your info so much on interviews. It&#39;s so memorable and keeps my attention (I have ADHD so I&#39;m really picky with videos). I&#39;ll definitely share your channel with people interviewing or anyone new to coding. If you decide to leave YouTube please keep these videos up. Also, you don&#39;t have that annoying &quot;Aren&#39;t you amazed how smart I am?&quot; arrogant vibe. You have a very humble, enthusiastic energy.  Okay, this comment is way too long it&#39;s kind of creepy, but I&#39;m a girl so how dangerous can I be? I just really wanted to let you know your videos are powerful and  I really appreciate the time you take to edit them, it makes watching/learning so much easier.

Today, his favorite candy shop is offering N candies, which are arranged in a line. The i-th candy in the line (counting starting from 1) has a sweetness level Si. Note that the sweetness level of a candy might be negative, which means the candy tastes bitter.<br><br>Supervin likes to eat sweet candies. However, candies with a combined sweetness level of more than D would be too much sweetness even for him. Supervin also realises that a candy with an odd sweetness level is &quot;odd&quot;, and he does not want to eat more than O odd candies. In other words, an odd candy is a candy with a sweetness level that is not evenly divisible by 2. Additionally, since Supervin is in a rush, he can only eat a single contiguous subset of candies.<br><br>Therefore, he wants to eat a contiguous non-empty subset of candies in which there are at most O odd candies and the total sweetness level is maximized, but not more than D.

I think I now understand that, in the case of bottom up computation, we use suffixes (we look from current position to the end of the string) and if we match 2 characters than we take the result of the previously matched suffixes -- the result would be at location dp[i - 1][j - 1] and increment it by 1.. which is the previous diagonal cell..

While watching youtube videos on algorithms, so many of the people solving them just seemingly grab the solution out of thin air. No doubt this is due to them doing a ton of algorithms in the past, recognizing patterns and reaching for solutions or similar solutions that worked for them in the past. The problem with this for people newer to solving algorithms is as I mentioned - this seems to come out of thin air and doesn&#39;t help, because it doesn&#39;t show the thought process behind what came up with the original pattern that they&#39;re grabbing for.. hope that makes sense and thanks again for the video.",2022-01-18T17:33:57Z

Both of those require paid accounts and are usually tied to your company. As always, you should follow whatever the team has decided to use so everyone is on the same page, even if it is less efficient. The use case for using python over the other two would be if you already have a lot of python as part of your workflow. I&#39;ve worked places where they use python over VBA for excel macros and there are a lot of internal tools and applications that use python. The other benefit is you can run these workflows in linux server environments really easily. Lastly, python is a lighter weight solution compared to PowerBI and Tableau. A .py file with these dependencies is much smaller and more portable than the other two. It really depends on your requirements and your use case. One is not necessarily better than the other.

So, when you get to calculate the max sum of a subarray ending with -2, it would be the max of ({-2}, {3,-2}, {2,3,-2}, {1,2,3,-2}) and the last subarray is the maximum, so the current sum would become 4, but the global sum is 6, so you won&#39;t update it.<br>Next, you&#39;ll have to find the max sum of a subarray ending with 5, it is either {5} or {current sum+5}. And the max is {current sum+5}. So, the current sum would be 4+5=9. <br>Eventually, you have to update the old global 6 with the greater current 9.<br>And the answer is 9.",2022-02-07T15:42:34Z

How do programmers approach the code of a complex application? is there a general structure for the code of mobile apps? What is required to be able to build an app that works well in the long run?

You know the julia-sets have all different not integer dimensions. I think it would be very interesting to have a map like the mandelbrot-set, that shows the magnitude of the dimension of the julia-set for that Parameter c.<br>So that a higher dimension creates a darker point. So the programme  needs to create the julia set, then to calculate it¬¥s dimension (i think box-counting) and then to give the point a magnitude. I am a beginner at programming and i don‚Äôt get it.

This is why we all need to be good and kind! All is recorded in the light which is the projector, which is displayed on the dark matter, god particle, the void, the screen. This is why we need to be good and kind! The sound is recorded forever in the sound waves that ripple on forever. Be good and kind! Both the sound and images are recorded for all to be judged in the light, dark, and the waves of vibration.<br><br>Even in the beginning when I was alone in the void, an age of time. Heaven was already made because time travel is possible in heaven. Heaven built on Earth!! We made Heaven, built it through the ages of time, but heaven was and is always here to protect us in a timeless form..<br><br>The rapture has no idea of time. Time travelers ‚Äúangels‚Äù could always come back and take the good and kind when ever they want, making sure no one would understand! <br><br>This is part of Gods plan! We must work together to make heaven on Earth with advancements in science and love for all! I am.. Is there still doubt in those who read this?<br><br>Heaven is past, present, and future! Always here in an age of timelessness, which is in our future! Much more to say.. many lessons to learn..

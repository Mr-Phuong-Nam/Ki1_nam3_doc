Let&#39;s say they&#39;re not -- that would mean we have a model that, given an input, produces multiple predicted outputs ---&gt; In other words multiple y-hats. However, a function by definition must have one output. <br><br>If we put the line or curve produced by the function on a graph, there&#39;s a simple test called the Straight Line Test that confirms whether we call that &quot;line&quot; a function of x. If you can find a location anywhere on the graph where you could draw a vertical line that intersects with the function&#39;s line more than once, then the function &quot;fails&quot; the test and is not considered a traditional function. <br><br>Put another way, we call the function a &quot;function of x&quot; because x is the variable that determines the result of the function. The output of the function, conversely, is something determined by x. <b>*So a univariate regression model is a model that has one input variable and one output variable.*</b><br><br>This might sound confusing, so let&#39;s use the house-price example from the video:<br>- each of the marks on the graph (the things shaped like a tilted &quot;+&quot; sign) represent a house of &quot;x&quot; square feet that we <b>know</b> was sold for &quot;y&quot; dollars<br>- we have more houses we want to sell --&gt; BUT while we <b>do</b> know the square feet of each of these houses to be sold...<br>  - we <b>don&#39;t</b> know how much they would sell for, since they haven&#39;t been sold yet<br>- to predict how much the house <b>might</b> sell for, we&#39;ll use some clever math that predicts the sale-price based off of how much those aforementioned &quot;known&quot; houses <b>did</b> sell for<br>- that math results in a formula that predicts the house price based on its square feet --&gt; when plotted on a graph, the output of this formula would draw a straight line<br>- that formula is called a function<br><br>- NOW, let&#39;s say we have a 1300-square-foot house we want to sell<br>- if we put 1300 into the formula, we&#39;d get a certain output, a prediction of how much the house would sell for --&gt; in this case let&#39;s just say the formula output was $100,000<br>- but what if the formula <b>also</b> produced an output of $200,000<br>- which house price is right? could we sell the house for $200,000? That&#39;s a lot more money, but if the prediction was supposed to be $100,000, then nobody will buy this overpriced house when other similar-sized houses are being sold for way less<br>- Thusly, a function with multiple outputs wouldn&#39;t be very useful, because of this ambiguity<br>- So again, the function <b>has</b> to have only one output, and univariate regressions must also have only one input<br><br>However, KEEP THIS IN MIND:<br>- what happens if we have sample data with the same x but different y?<br>- in other words, what does it mean if we <b>know</b> that a 1200 square foot house was sold for $60,000, but ANOTHER 1200 square foot house was sold for $80,000 --&gt; that&#39;s two different outputs, two different y&#39;s; what does this mean?<br>- Nothing has changed, our function still works and will still make predictions based off of all the sample data<br>- This is because the sample data itself is <b>not</b> a function - they&#39;re just individual entities that we use to train our function<br><br>This will make more sense once the math is explained in the videos. <br>Hope this helps.",2023-09-28T17:45:40Z

We are drawing a line between a dataset with two (or more) supervised variables, and we want to minimize error such that we have a function that predicts future unsupervised output. Meaning --- how can we get price and square footage to relate to one another such that if we get new sq footage, we can predict a future price that is probably pretty accurate. There is no creativity with stats (it&#39;s all pre-programmed), so I&#39;d talk about what we are doing in practical terms. Will still stick to the end regardless......",2023-08-31T00:17:43Z

In pytorch for the faster r-cnn framework with torchvision you can input a shape of any size, and the GeneralTransform module will rescale it to a fixed min and max size. Convolution operations do not require a certain spatial size as input, although you will see in Tensorflow that they often have checks for the input shape size that do restrict the shape of the image, however this is not necessary in my opinion. The ROI pool operation from the Faster R-CNN architecture gives you a fixed size tensor no matter what your input shape is (assuming it has 3 channels as in an RGB image of course).",2021-02-16T21:16:06Z

When we apply the 2nd set of convolution 16 filters - do we not apply this filter on the 6 channels we produced in the  previous layer?  Therefore the final output after the 2nd pooling should be  5X5 X 16filters X 6 filters  = 400x6=2400 ?,2018-09-10T14:11:47Z

Every filter should be visualized as a 3d matrix , i.e. a volume.  Each layer in the volume operates on each of the channels. E.g. In case of R,G,B picture, the first layer of filters would have 3 matrices each , 1 matrix for R, 1 matrix for G, 1 matrixfor B.   The 3 matrices in a single filter would operate on the R,G,B image to produce a single 2d matrix. Now 6 filters in the first layer produce 6 two dimensional matrices. Think of the count 6 as a picture with 6 channels. Therefore in the subsequent filter layers, your input picture is made up of 6 two dimensional matrices.  Each of the 16 filters in the second filter layer have a depth of 6 in the 3 rd dimension, i.e. a stack of 6 two dimensional matrices. Therefore 16 of these 6 channeled filters operate on the input image (which can be thought of as a 6 channel image produced by convolution in the first layer).",2018-09-23T10:13:55Z

What you&#39;re doing is using this fixed function, in this first part of the neural network, to take this input any image X and compute some feature vector for it and then you&#39;re training a shallow softmax model from this feature vector to make a prediction. One step that could help your computation as you just precompute that layers activation, for all the examples in training sets and save them to disk and then just train the softmax clause right on top of that. The advantage of the save to disk or the pre-compute method or the save to disk is that you don&#39;t need to recompute those activations every time you take a epoch or take a post through a training set. This is what you do if you have a pretty small training set for your task.&quot;",2019-05-01T13:40:28Z

I think is easier save your feature vector of all the training set and compile them as a new data and then training only with the predicted layer (softmax function) like a perceptron.

If the detector mark only half of the body of the lost person it still will be helpful for the operator.

Layer by layer we perform forward prop, but we stop at every layer to apply our dropout filter, once it is applied to the previous layer we go to the next layer and compute the activations with those units turned off, we then apply the filter to the current layer and do the same steps for all hidden layers . If we did this without the scaling what would have happened ? Some of the signal would be lost completely meaning that the output would be reduced.  We have to understand that regularization is not designed to impact the forward prop, but rather back prop, and the propagation of the error through the weights. The fact that some units are deactivated will make the error propagation prioritize different weights at different training examples. If we trace it back to L2 regularization we force that regularization and prioritization of weights to happen similarly for all training examples, in dropout we mix it a bit more. Another way of looking at it is that if we didn&#39;t scale our  activation&#39;s we would be probably increasing the magnitude of error for that training example, which is not what we want, we are after the same error, but propagated differently so that some parameters get decreased, and thus we have a simpler hypothesis.",2019-10-31T11:40:29Z

It is possible and it is the input matrices if you look at loss estimation functions but I think you make this VDO must to have some contents that innovations.<br><br>🐑💬 It effects by creating small values from input matrices by dividing them from the estimates target value, now the weights update does not only increase or decrease value parameters from the training function but its relationship remains as the SoftMax layer does.<br>🐐💬 Do you mean even networks have likely and unlikely ⁉<br>👧💬 Yes of course and how about the dropout may be he aim to prunes the dropout from the leafs nodes by priority.",2023-04-27T06:10:29Z

Isn’t it really only RMS prop (or the RMS prop component of Adam), not momentum, that helps solve the plateau problem?  Momentum only solves problem of gradient swinging back and forth (overshooting) between positive and negative, which is not a plateau situation.<br>   On further reflection, maybe momentum can help a bit with plateau problem, as well, in some situations. Where one is not overshooting, but moving very slowly down plateau with declining gradients, momentum’s averaging current small gradient with prior larger gradients yields faster move down plateau.  So momentum helps a bit, though not nearly as much as RMS prop, which specifically boosts effective learning rate where the gradients are small.  <br>    Am I getting this right?",2022-02-04T03:07:19Z

Autodiff is the chain rule applied to computational graphs, which describe a computation in terms of operational primitives. For example, if my function is f(x, y) = xy + x^2, I can describe this as a computational graph. If r1 = x*y, r2 = x*x, and r3 = r1 + r2, then the derivatives of these operations are all primitive derivatives. I know that dr1/dx = y, dr2/dx = 2x, dr3/dr1 = 1 and dr3/dr2 = 1. So, if I wanted to know df/dx, then using the chain rule I would need to compute dr3/dr1*dr1/dx + dr3/dr2*dr2/dx, which is equal to 1*y + 1*2x. Now you have the derivatives in terms of values that you will get on the forward pass. <br><br>The only thing that needs to be programmed is the derivative rule for a primitive operation (addition, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logs, trig functions). That way, at each node in the computational graph, the derivative can be described in terms of the inputs to the node, which will be part of the larger chain rule.",2020-12-05T03:34:43Z

You can use the chain rule to figure this out. So, the first step is to figure out the difference in L with respect to z. To figure this out, you calculate the derivative of the function L = -(ylog a).... after you figure this out, you calculate the derivative of z with respect to w1. In this case, the the derivative is simply x1. After simplifying both derivatives, the end result is you have the derivative of L with respect to w1. This is what you use to carry out the gradient descent. So you use the newly calculated dW1 and calculate a new w1 (ie newW1 = oldW1 - (learning rate Alpha * dW1)).

Let&#39;s take two weights w1 = -0.2 and w2 = 0.5, and a linear function like lets say f(x) = 3x+0.2. Then f(w1) = -0.4 and f(w2) = 1.7. This function preserves the difference (up to a linear factor) between the two weights (w2-w1 = 0.7, and  f(w2)-f(w1) = 3* (w2-w1)=2.1. You will always have this with linear functions, but with a function like ReLU you will not (only interesting of course if at least one of the weights are negative). Now maybe this math is just nonsense, but I think I got a point here somewhere. In a sense you cannot write old weights as a &quot;linear combination&quot; of new weights.",2019-04-04T07:48:52Z

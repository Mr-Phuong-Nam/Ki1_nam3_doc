In rust like any other high level languages such as c and c++, you don&#39;t actually copy value of an object in heap by default, rather it copies the address that points to that object. Also it&#39;s worth mentioning that in rust each variable is responsible for managing their space in heap, meaning compiler will add the &quot;drop(address)&quot; invocation as soon as the variable becomes out of scope. However by passing the variable &quot;input&quot; to &quot;read_line&quot; function you also pass the responsibility (a.k.a Ownership) of it. As a result the call to &quot;drop&quot; function occurs at the end of the lifetime of the parameter in &quot;read_line&quot; function, that is at the end of the function. Which means the value of input becomes unavailable after the call to read_line function. Sorry for the lengthy explanation, just trying to share my understanding of rust with other learners.

Only a select few types that implement the Copy trait are allowed to be implicitly copied like that.  Ownership of a variable really only has to do with who is responsible for managing the memory. Giving ownership of a piece of data to someone else is essentially equivalent to telling the compiler you will never access that data again within the same scope.<br><br>In your example, you supposed transferring ownership of a heap-allocated String to a function. Heap-allocated objects are never directly accessible to a function, since they don&#39;t live on the stack (they live on the heap), so ownership of a heap-allocated variable is really just ownership of a pointer to a place in memory.  Internally, passing a &quot;String&quot; or a &quot;&amp;String&quot; is the exact same thing: you&#39;re just passing a pointer to a place on the heap.<br><br>I hope that it is now clear that passing a String vs a &amp;String is <i>not the same thing</i> as pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value.<br><br>So what does it actually do?<br>I already quickly mentioned that ownership has to do with a sort of contract with the compiler as to who is responsible for the piece of memory. With this contract the compiler can decide when to delete your stuff.<br><b>Transferring</b> ownership of a piece of data (so passing a String as &quot;String&quot; or &quot;mut String&quot;) to a function tells the compiler that you do not want to access the data anymore outside of the function, so the compiler will destroy the object after the function has been run. <br><b>Borrowing</b> ownership of a piece of data (passing it as &quot;&amp;String&quot; or &quot;&amp;mut String&quot;) in a function signature tells the compiler that you DO need the data after the function completed, so it can&#39;t go ahead and delete it for you yet. <br><br>So why does read_line() take a borrowed String rather than an owned one?<br>Well, if you want user input, you usually want to be able to look at it afterwards. Passing the owned String would&#39;ve told the compiler it is ok to delete the string after it had been filled with user input. We don&#39;t want that, that&#39;s why you pass in a borrowed String.",2022-05-18T20:48:02Z

<br>that is their song
<br>with joyful ring
<br>all caroling
<br>One seems to hear
<br>words of good cheer
<br>from everywhere
<br>filling the air
<br>Oh how they pound
<br>raising the sound
<br>o&#39;er hill and dale
<br>telling their tale
<br>Gaily they ring
<br>while people sing
<br>songs of good cheer
<br>Christmas is here
<br>Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
<br>Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
<br>On on they send
<br>on without end
<br>their joyful tone
<br>to every home

I got a paid internship at a company that protects data for hospitals. The internship first day introduction day (last week) I was told by HR and some senior employees that I will be rotating first doing QA Engineering job (testing apps from the developers, watching out for bugs, zoom meetings and scrum). Then I&#39;ll be rotating to write code in Java. HR later gave me a Powerpoint presentation and one of the slides had info about all the job positions people can apply to and get a bonus by bringing in a new recruit. But the HR lady said it does not apply to interns. During my first week I have done nothing but trainings and explanations of the platforms. I feel like it&#39;s a lot for a team. So, the question is if with all this, do you think if I ask them if I could stay permanently there or to have my stay there extended. If so, at what point I should ask? My full time internship ends ending August. My concern is that I did the decision of quitting my previous job as an Assistant for nurses in order to have this opportunity. Just in case I signed up for algoexpert and train coding problems so I can be prepare and start applying to jobs at other companies. But, I&#39;m concerned about this because I have 3 months before my income ends. Please let me know.",2021-06-07T18:34:56Z

You don&#39;t need to include the string library to just declare a string. you can declare string by using only the iostream library. The string library only contains some functions needed to manipulate strings only and not necessarily needed if you are just declaring string like you did in previous videos. Also it is a good practice for beginners to not include the namespace std. by not using it, you will have to use std:: before a function that is declared in that namespace and it is better to know which functions are declared in the namespace or not. When you&#39;re learning, it&#39;s better to use the std:: as you will get an idea which function is in the standard namespace and which are not.",2021-03-17T16:14:30Z

I have just learned about c few months back in collage and I wondered that what I have learnt was absolutely correct regarding the pointer and usage of pointer in data structures most of my classmates feels like pointers as a mysterious concept and they even feel like it&#39;s waste of time learning these shit. They just want  to become toppers in semisters!! I don&#39;t why there are doing a cs degree with out learning anything about memory management and threading things like this and they even don&#39;t know whats the importance of memory management in computer science. I know I am gonna fail in all my exams as usual but I am feeling very satisfied this time with the stuff what I have learnt through internet and the oops concept from your videos they thinks this is also a tuf concept.

Vectors are what you need to know to solve the problems. I was so confused when first trying some problems because I had the right mindset but an array wont cut it. Its as you said, regular arrays are good for when you know what you need. it has to have a static and constant size.

An iterator for a simple vector class for example is simply incrementing by 1 the address of a pointer so its really cheap either way and you wont notice a performance impact when looping, but there might be a class that is really complex and the ++ operator could be doing a lot more work behind the scenes. Most iterators dont really matter, but usually, the ++n implementation is slightly faster than the n++ one because it doesnt have to copy a temporary value.<br><br>The general rule of thump is that ++i is either faster or as fast as i++ when working with custom classes or iterators for custom classes.<br><br>A real life example of why this could matter:<br>Imagine i have an &quot;entity&quot; class where i store a lot of information about each entity, such as a string for the name, an unsigned int for its age, some doubles for its X, Y and Z position, etc etc... If i want to store these &quot;entities&quot; inside of a simple list class (for example a linked list or a vector), each element im storing is of a certain custom class that occupies a lot of space in memory per member, because it has to store a lot of member variables for each entity. If i have an iterator, the ++itr will simply return a reference to the next element in the list, while using the itr++ will have to copy the element into a temporary value, because returning references to temporary values is not going to work (the temporary is temporary after all, so you really have to make a copy, you cant return a reference to that) which means im copying the whole element for each loop the iterator does if i use an itr++. For a list of ints this might not matter, but as i said, if im using a class that contains a big amount of data per member, it will slow down the program&#39;s performance.<br><br>Here&#39;s a simple implementation of the operators n++ and ++n for an iterator for a vector class so you see what i mean:<br><br>//this is the operator that goes ++i<br>const T &amp; operator++()<br>{<br>   return ++ptr;<br>}<br><br>//this is the operator that goes i++<br>T operator++(int)<br>{<br>   T * temp = ptr;<br>   ++ptr;<br>   return temp;<br>}<br><br>as you can see, the operator for i++ has a lot more info inside.<br><br>Now, putting all of this aside, let me remind you this is for custom classes. For regular ints in a for loop it doesnt really matter because as i already said, modern compilers will automatically optimize that so you can use i++ if you want if you are working with ints. If you are working with anything else, just to be safe use ++i for performance.<br><br>Im not english so sorry if the explanation was not clear enough. I did my best i guess :P",2022-04-08T23:31:07Z

If you want processes to kill, just run some dummy processes in the background.  If you want to make it clear which commands impact just the user, log in as a non-root user.  Someone else asked why you are running as root, a valid question.  Teach the use of sudo before delving into admin stuff.  If you need to do a bunch of privileged commands in a row, use sudo sh (or your preferred shell) rather than logging in as root.  However, the hidden advantage of running sudo with every command is that it logs each of them for accountability.  Need to find out which junior admin is repeatedly screwing up this and that?  Check the logs!  Need to figure out what you typed that gave you unexpected results a while later?  Check the logs.  Can&#39;t do that so conveniently without sudo.",2021-10-11T19:36:17Z

My entire Python experience is about 6 months. I have done some intermediate level projects like building a library for statistical astrological analysis with integration from NASA&#39;s algrithms for planetary motion. Now, I&#39;m really passionate about building a cross-platform app which will contain a bunch of high school &amp; college level physics simulations &amp; interactive animations for students. Such an app will really inspire students to learn Physics  &amp; Python. <br>So far, thanks to your amazing tutorials &amp; some other online resources, I managed to learn vpython &amp; made about 25 simulations. Right now they are just individual Python modules in my Pycharm project. I cannot figure out how to put them all together in a nice user interface that behaves like an app. I am somewhat familiar with Tkinter, Kivy &amp; PyQt but cannot quite figure out which one is best suitable for my project, especially considering that it has to work with vpython. <br>Can vpython be integrated with something like kivy so that the simulations play in a kivy canvas kind of thing?<br>Is what I am trying to do even possible with pure Python or do I need to think about the whole idea from scratch? <br>Please guide me.<br>- Thanks in advance.<br>P.S. : I know this question is not relevant to the video posted, but I figured since this is your latest video, it would be easier for you find this query.",2020-11-21T14:26:45Z

I see some comments on the class based components vs functional. I am not a front end web developer and hence don&#39;t have a strong opinion on which should be used. From some light research it seems as though functional components are recommended. In this series we do use CLASS based components. As most of the videos are already filmed it will be hard to reverse this decision but I will make a video discussing how to translate them to functional near the end of the series. Regardless class based components are still a part of react and their what was used solely in the microsoft code base I worked in.

<br>import React, { Component } from &quot;react&quot;;
<br>import RoomJoinPage from &quot;./RoomJoinPage&quot;;

Yes generators learn to map random input vectors to fake flowers without any prior knowledge of how flowers generally look, however one can use a pretrained encoder from Image encoder and decoder neural network that has been trained to encode and decode flower images. This way the generator would have some prior knowledge on where to look in a given input of random vector to generate flowers thus making the convergence faster<br><br>2. In GANs just like how we pass on random input vector, while converting text to images, one can make use of an encoder network to map the input text into embeddings (something that&#39;s called word embeddings in the NLP domain). Now these embeddings can be passed to GANs inplace of the random input vector. But in this case the descriminator has to have knowledge to perform multi-class classification, as text-to-images might involve generating multiple objects/entities unlike in GANs alone where we try to generate only one particular entity like flowers, or faces or cats etc",2023-02-12T06:05:12Z

Besides, the RBM is energy-based (hence it has an energy function which can be said to be instead of a loss function) and follows (a simplified version of) the Boltzmann distribution (that doesn&#39;t include k and T), so it is stochastic, while a feedforward network isn&#39;t energy-based, but is instead deterministic.",2023-08-31T16:40:41Z

The AI model consequently would spit out gibberish or false information at best. <br>And that&#39;s the main problem with statistical models: 1) They are as good as the data that are being fed,  2) There is no actual way for any AI (statistical model) to distinguish truth/accurate from false/inaccurate data.

The new tech comes a roaring like a lion. Great work on achieving but why did Watson not do the same considering it won jeopardy more than a decade ago and project debater. Wow that was revolutionary. The transparency of all these models are datasets we choose. Maybe ensuring that all models met a strict criteria. Hence auditing I guess.  I have heard alot of concern from people and tend to agree with these legitimized concerns. It should be able to do what Watson did and not produce an answer till it is ready to run. Watching the jeopardy challenge was an eye opener. Based on percentage an answer was given. Or not at all. That was a good solution. Keep it up and open folks we all need to have the talk. This is new and what we lack is the experience. Sad but aging seems that way too. Just the way of the world I tend to observe. It‚Äôs time that will tell this story. Hope we can get it right.

So even things like the shift in word use frequency when ingesting the Google books corpus are problematic.  As are the attitudes towards other sexes and races, etc... In those writings.  Watson did well on the game show, but didn&#39;t do so hot at their other hopes for it.  It largely failed to make headway on biomedical problems and pharmaceuticals and was unable to generate the profit IBM had hoped it might.  The people that work in these domains understand how their data works and the potential for sophisticated models to fail in actual application, hence why linear modeling is still so common for them.  It isn&#39;t just them being Luddites or dinosaurs, it&#39;s that it isn&#39;t their rodeo.  They&#39;ve been through building sophisticated models and watching them fail to improve real diagnosis rates on new incoming patients because they have more systemic but shifting (non-stationary) differences in their mean and standard deviation, etc... that the models spuriously relied on.  I see the same thing all the time now.  It goes like this: <br>1) They gather a nice curated data set<br>2) They split into test and train<br>3) They use train to build the model, test on test and results are great, seems like it generalizes to test data.  They say, &quot;let&#39;s use this for real in the clinic!&quot;<br>4) They try it in the clinic and results are not necessarily awful,... but they&#39;re below the benchmark heuristic or standard measure previously in use.  The new data is messier and had systemic differences from the training/testing data, and again, these characteristics drift over time, so the longer they try to keep it going in the clinic, the worse things seem to get.  <br>5) The publish that good part from before they went to the real world use case and the real case is a failure so they don&#39;t even try to publish it.  People get more hyped and gassed up on the sophisticated new methods.  <br>6) Eventually people become disillusioned, but not until failing themselves.  In the macro scale you get things like the &quot;AI Winter.&quot;  <br><br>It&#39;s difficult to scrutinize the model data because it&#39;s so large.

The AI model consequently would spit out gibberish or false information at best. <br>And that&#39;s the main problem with statistical models: 1) They are as good as the data that are being fed,  2) There is no actual way for any AI (statistical model) to distinguish truth/accurate from false/inaccurate data.

The new tech comes a roaring like a lion. Great work on achieving but why did Watson not do the same considering it won jeopardy more than a decade ago and project debater. Wow that was revolutionary. The transparency of all these models are datasets we choose. Maybe ensuring that all models met a strict criteria. Hence auditing I guess.  I have heard alot of concern from people and tend to agree with these legitimized concerns. It should be able to do what Watson did and not produce an answer till it is ready to run. Watching the jeopardy challenge was an eye opener. Based on percentage an answer was given. Or not at all. That was a good solution. Keep it up and open folks we all need to have the talk. This is new and what we lack is the experience. Sad but aging seems that way too. Just the way of the world I tend to observe. It‚Äôs time that will tell this story. Hope we can get it right.

So even things like the shift in word use frequency when ingesting the Google books corpus are problematic.  As are the attitudes towards other sexes and races, etc... In those writings.  Watson did well on the game show, but didn&#39;t do so hot at their other hopes for it.  It largely failed to make headway on biomedical problems and pharmaceuticals and was unable to generate the profit IBM had hoped it might.  The people that work in these domains understand how their data works and the potential for sophisticated models to fail in actual application, hence why linear modeling is still so common for them.  It isn&#39;t just them being Luddites or dinosaurs, it&#39;s that it isn&#39;t their rodeo.  They&#39;ve been through building sophisticated models and watching them fail to improve real diagnosis rates on new incoming patients because they have more systemic but shifting (non-stationary) differences in their mean and standard deviation, etc... that the models spuriously relied on.  I see the same thing all the time now.  It goes like this: <br>1) They gather a nice curated data set<br>2) They split into test and train<br>3) They use train to build the model, test on test and results are great, seems like it generalizes to test data.  They say, &quot;let&#39;s use this for real in the clinic!&quot;<br>4) They try it in the clinic and results are not necessarily awful,... but they&#39;re below the benchmark heuristic or standard measure previously in use.  The new data is messier and had systemic differences from the training/testing data, and again, these characteristics drift over time, so the longer they try to keep it going in the clinic, the worse things seem to get.  <br>5) The publish that good part from before they went to the real world use case and the real case is a failure so they don&#39;t even try to publish it.  People get more hyped and gassed up on the sophisticated new methods.  <br>6) Eventually people become disillusioned, but not until failing themselves.  In the macro scale you get things like the &quot;AI Winter.&quot;  <br><br>It&#39;s difficult to scrutinize the model data because it&#39;s so large.

Some of the comments around SPI, VPN, and (micro-)segmentaion seemed a bit off.  Looking inside the packet payload is still mostly regular packet inspection.  As you said but perhaps not forcefully enough, the stateful part is where that packet fits within a larger sequence/flow/protocol.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone else call SSH a form of VPN.  Some VPNs use SSH vs. IPSEC to make an encrypted connection from point A to B, but that seems a different concept.  I rarely hear people discussing segmentation in that sort of left-to-right from secure to private context.  I usually hear that term within one of those areas for splitting up dev, qa, and production (internal) or mail servers, dns servers, and web servers (dmz/external).

First, consider the packet filtering firewall.  It operates on the 5-tuple ( protocol, source and destination IP address, source and destination port ) in only one direction.  Thus, two rules are required to allow bi-directional traffic.  Generally, the packet filtering firewall is in the form of an Access Control List (ACL) on a physical device, and is not a physical device on its own.<br><br>The stateful firewall eliminates the single direction limitation by implementing a connection table that tracks traffic in one direction and automatically implements policy to allow the traffic to return.  Only one rule is required to allow bi-directional traffic.  This type of firewall is commonly a physical device, but can take the form of a type of ACL or software on a host ( i.e. Windows Firewall ).<br><br>Deep packet inspection is not directly related to either of the two firewall types, although it is most commonly found in stateful firewalls.  DPI simply refers to the fact that the firewall can look beyond the packet headers and into the payload, as part of the decision to allow or drop the traffic.  The effectiveness of DPI is limited by encryption.  The firewall cannot protect against what it cannot see.  This limitation is commonly overcome through the use of decryption of inbound traffic and re-encryption as the traffic leaves the firewall, which comes at a cost of higher CPU usage and added latency.",2023-11-27T03:09:47Z

Many years ago, I was a computer tech, even before there was such a thing as a &quot;PC&quot;.  I worked for a telecommunications company and most of our computers were used for message switching.  On one occasion, a TV station wanted to do a piece on our computers.  However, they didn&#39;t think the computers were doing anything, so we had to run diagnostics on the tape stands, to make them look busy.  üôÇ<br>Computers have advanced over the years.  Way back in the dark ages, computers were built for either business or science &amp; engineering.  IBM&#39;s early business computers used fixed point decimal, while the S&amp;E systems used floating point.  This also applied to computer languages, with COBOL used for business and FORTRAN for S&amp;E.  This was necessary because the computers back then were so limited, they had to be customized for the intended market.  Later, as computers became more powerful, they became general purpose.  Also, after the introduction of mini-computers and later, personal computers, the mainframes continued for high performance applications.  They also evolved from single CPU with I/O processors, to multi-CPU, just like PCs.  These days, one of my cousins, a nuclear physicist, uses a &quot;mainframe&quot;, actually a multi CPU system, running Linux, in his studies of neutrinos.<br>BTW, regarding the 3270 green screen, I used to work at IBM Canada in the late 90s, as an OS/2 product specialist.

We did have a few mainframes that ran VM, but those were &quot;minor&quot; system.  These VM systems could run tons of VM type servers, which could support tons of websites.  However, the main systems that I supported were the billing systems.  I remember that the company did toy with the idea to migrating to a distributed (many multiple smaller CPU) systems, but these systems were too slow to handle the volume of programs that were run on the mainframes to produce the bills, and this was a 24 hour/6-7 day/52 week operations billing cycles.  So the only systems powerful enough to handle this were IBM mainframes.  The company had to continuously upgrade to the latest IBM mainframes, which costs millions and millions of dollars, but that was necessary to be able to process the bills.

Mainframes are great for running monolithic Cobol/PL/1/Assembler applications using batch jobs or OLTP (CICS/IMS) against say DB2 relational databases. That stack is super efficient and the I/O optimisations in Z/OS and the hardware make it sing for those workloads. That&#39;s where you do get the 40x efficiency (seriously) and it might even make sense economically (probably not though). But modern workloads are very CPU intensive compared with Cobol and very inefficient. All that object oriented code and web service calls and XML and JSON, most of it is shunting data around memory without doing anything. But on modern machines costing peanuts, it doesn&#39;t matter, what does is the abstraction benefits of using modern software techniques. I&#39;m sure the Tellum chip is super performant and well integrated but at the end of the day a mainframe cpu core on a the same silicon process won&#39;t be that different performance wise from a cloud cpu. Sure, the MCM is highly integrated with it&#39;s 250 odd cores, but it&#39;s so much more expensive - it&#39;s irrelevant to non locked in customers.

The mainframe architecture has been around since the 1950s (that&#39;s over 70 years now), but the newest systems are completely technologically modern.    The reason for the enduring misconception of mainframes being old is far, FAR more people are familiar with PC-based Linux systems than mainframes (and it&#39;s always been that way ever since Linux came out in the early 1990 and became much more prevalent by the late 1990s).  What helps educate people about IBM&#39;s offerings is the ongoing work with zXplore and Z-Days, and Zowe in VSC.  The Linux-optimized systems need demonstrator accounts (like the LinuxONE over at Marist). to allow people to play around with the system.   The zD&amp;T system helps, but the single-user insistence for the student license is a handicap (real mainframes in the real world are never single-user, except maybe at IPL) as application development is always going to be multiuser.  It helps to IBM could enhance user training with the possibility of a PC-scale &quot;toy mainframe&quot; that anyone can have. The &quot;toy mainframe&quot; does enough of the real mainframe can do to be educational, but compared to a real mainfame it just does much less and much more slowly (because at its core it&#39;s a PC with emulators - a bit like a Linux box or Windows box running Hercules Hyperion.. And also as far as mainframes IBM has enjoyed decades of generous exposure - everyone knows what an &quot;IBM mainframe&quot; is - - Far fewer are aware of Unisys (now a subsidiary of SAIC) or Groupe Bull (France, bought GE&#39;s mainframe business a few decades ago).   Be out there, be friendly, be very available, support students and hobbyists (there are mainframe hobbyists) along with your installed base, and be friendly.  Train them to be IBM customers and maximally allow educational materials. Those people wind up in data centers debating whether to rack up  the upgrades with IBM, Dell, or HP.

You program the API with a programming language SDK.  In summary, the SDK helps you to build the API.  Now you can always use the raw elements provided by a programming language to build the API, but an SDK helps you get there faster by &quot;packaging&quot; capabilities into one subset of operations.  For instance, think of Node.JS and Express.  You can build a WebServer with paths and methods to make a REST API always.

I come from the mainframe performance monitoring area and academically I understand what observability definition is from control theory. Now I am facing all these new changes and digital transformations, specifically in the mainframe area, where I work as a Produt Manager. I am trying to learn these new concepts, but here are some observations:<br>-	The video starts by saying that APM, Monitoring, and Observability are different terms and then examines why? But you only discuss an Observavilty Solution instead<br>-	It seems that observability is primarily related to the Collection/generation of meaningful data. If this is entirely different than traditional monitoring, it is where the lines get fuzzy. Any monitoring solution (even monolithic) requires a sort of generation and collection of some kind of  data, analysis and action, so what&#39;s the difference?.<br>-	Also, when you build the 3 step process, you refer this as Observability Solution but do not explain what observability is?<br>-	 I think what is most important (please forgive me because I am learning this) is how you manage relations of the unpredictable distributed systems and applications (you mention this at the end)<br>-  Instana is the IBM observability solution, but there  is no clear distinction of the 3 terms (APM/Observability/Monitoring).<br>Thanks again, I enjoyed and learn a lot with your videos.",2021-07-13T00:31:48Z

It is equivalent to data swamps as data stroed inside also can be inaccurate, duplicate or inaccurate data which can not be used for querying or for Business Intelligence.<br>In order to use this data, Data is cleaned first and then loaded into Data Warehouse through ETL process. It is easily queryable and can be used for BI and report generation. But it has two disadvantages :- <br>1. The cost of data warehouse is too high <br>2.

E.g. if it&#39;s not &quot;found&quot; (not labelled so nobody knows what it is) and when it is recognized that it&#39;s a duplicate of something else are not the same things. In the first case you don&#39;t know what the value is, and in the 2nd case the actual/original data has the same value as before and the copy of it has no value.<br>- well, when it comes to have a lakehouse, the restaurant could force the supplier to dock at a special place to load ONLY vegetables or ONLY meat, so reducing the amount of &quot;labeling&quot; (obviously it has some additional costs to build different docks and certain restaurants (small ones) may not be able to afford that) so on the same way a data lake could apply some data warehouse &quot;principles&quot; to increase the structured-ness and the possibility of &quot;governance&quot;.<br>- It reminds me the sci-fi writer Stanislav Lem&#39;s novel where he describes how the wireless communication was &quot;invented&quot;: &quot;the engineers made the diameter of the wire by which the communication was done smaller... and then even smaller... and then a bit more... and at one point... there was no wire...&quot; üôÇ",2023-06-08T15:39:22Z

It&#39;s basically a centralized place where an organization stores all their different data, allowing for many types of analytics at a larger scale (e.g social media data).<br>While a data pipeline is a system that filters these large amounts of data in order to provide a more concise and insightful set of analytics to the organization.

It is equivalent to data swamps as data stroed inside also can be inaccurate, duplicate or inaccurate data which can not be used for querying or for Business Intelligence.<br>In order to use this data, Data is cleaned first and then loaded into Data Warehouse through ETL process. It is easily queryable and can be used for BI and report generation. But it has two disadvantages :- <br>1. The cost of data warehouse is too high <br>2. Apps wants to consume fresh data may not get it from Data warehouse as it ETL process takes time to load data into warehoulse. <br>Hence to solve the shortcomings of both Data Lake and Data Warehouse, concept of data lakehouse is introduced",2023-09-09T13:41:41Z

E.g. if it&#39;s not &quot;found&quot; (not labelled so nobody knows what it is) and when it is recognized that it&#39;s a duplicate of something else are not the same things. In the first case you don&#39;t know what the value is, and in the 2nd case the actual/original data has the same value as before and the copy of it has no value.<br>- well, when it comes to have a lakehouse, the restaurant could force the supplier to dock at a special place to load ONLY vegetables or ONLY meat, so reducing the amount of &quot;labeling&quot; (obviously it has some additional costs to build different docks and certain restaurants (small ones) may not be able to afford that) so on the same way a data lake could apply some data warehouse &quot;principles&quot; to increase the structured-ness and the possibility of &quot;governance&quot;.<br>- It reminds me the sci-fi writer Stanislav Lem&#39;s novel where he describes how the wireless communication was &quot;invented&quot;: &quot;the engineers made the diameter of the wire by which the communication was done smaller... and then even smaller... and then a bit more... and at one point... there was no wire...&quot; üôÇ",2023-06-08T15:39:22Z

That may be the source of your confusion. Sorry about that! But to clarify, there&#39;s two issues at play here: (1) How do you know the message you received is actually from who you think it is?  (2) How do  you establish secure communication with someone?¬†<br><br>For (1), you as the receiver of a message from SND know that <b>must</b> have originated from SND if you&#39;re able to decrypt it with SND&#39;s public key, because only SND has their [private] key that was used to encrypt it.¬†<br><br>Let&#39;s say for (2), SND wants to establish a secure connection with RCV. To start, SND creates a unique SND-to-RCV session ID &quot;ZZZ&quot; and wants to send it to RCV. So, SND uses RCV&#39;s public key to encrypt the session ID ZZZ, encrypts that with their own (SND&#39;s) private key, then sends the &quot;package&quot; to RCV. It&#39;s true that someone <b>could</b> intercept that package and use SND&#39;s public key to decrypt it, but all that would get them was RCV&#39;s (encrypted) session ID, which is worthless to the interceptor. On the other hand, RCV can decrypt the package using SND&#39;s public key <b>and</b> they can also decrypt the message to retrieve the session ID using their private key since SND used RCV&#39;s public key to encrypt it. Once this is complete, both SND and RCV share a session ID that nobody else knows; that can be used to establish a secure connection with both parties knowing the other end is who they claim to be.<br><br>Another easier way to think of it is a message encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted with the associated private key. Thus you can use this asymmetry to prove that a message did in fact originate with the owner of the public/private key, because any tampering along the way would render the message gibberish when decrypted.<br><br><br>Did I get it right, @jeffcrume?",2023-02-03T21:48:52Z

Conventional PCs are something that you can with have a lot of freedom and flexibility. Essentially you can do whatever you want with your PC - re-program it, install software on it, play with it... However an edge computing device is something that is more likely administered by a central service provider (i.e. Amazon Alexa offered by Amazon) that you cannot easily tamper with, but it does have enough processing power to do many things locally rather than always having to talk to the Cloud. A prime example is a self-driving car. A self-driving Tesla is an epitome an &quot;edge computer&quot; which drives your car without having talking to the Cloud - and quite conceivably so. Moreover, a Tesla self-driving car receives upgrades from Tesla every once in a while - a sign of being administered by Tesla. Last but not least, you can&#39;t re-program a Tesla to let it ignore pedestrians in front of itself otherwise it&#39;d become a really cheap assassin... Hope it helps.",2020-06-17T23:52:32Z

Where does the edge computing perform i.e in edge device itself or in edge server. If it performs the computing in edge servers then in the case of autonomous vehicles we cant expect continuous network connection because of its mobility. So in this case if the network connection is lost then how can the edge server communicate with that autonomous vehicle.,2019-12-26T18:00:15Z

Ur private ip address is not recognized by google so ur router does the talking to the internet. It is like a cell phone which allows u to talk to <a href=""http://google.so/"">google.So</a> ur private ip address is converted into the internet ipaddress with the help of net masking which u can see on seeing ifconfig which shows that ur private ip address is converted into the routers ip address. Basically when u buy internet connection you are buying an ipaddress that can talk to the world.Ur ISP has globally bought a range of ip address from IANA and it is giving u an ipaddress. So all the devices which access internet from ur home would actually be converted into the routers ip address in ur router and those packets are shoots up into the <a href=""http://net.so/"">net.So</a> ur router does the working of a postman when it receives reply from google and internally unmask the ipaddress to determine who was the person who send that request.",2020-06-21T02:03:15Z

NOSQL predates Relational Databases by decades (1960s) and was called Hierarchical Databases. When Edgar F. Codd invented Relational Databases (early 1970s), computers weren&#39;t powerful enough to support them and it wasn&#39;t until 1979 the Oracle truly commercialized Relational Databases. Just like today Relational Databases need more computing power than the simpler NOSQL Database. This is because the main drawcard of RDBMs needs it, &quot;Data Relationships&quot;. Without the relationships that SQL provides, one has to write the joins into their own code whether it be Python, Ruby, C++ , Go etc or rely on the same or similar SQL syntax to do perform joins (Hadoop, Splunk come to mind). SQL reduced the proliferation of code needed to do joins. Imagine having downstream systems using multiple programming languages, each one having to munge their own joins. RDBMs also provide other things such as ACID, which ensures your data is in a consistent state even if there are conflicts. Frankly once the data is normalised it easier to work with SQL plus ORMs.",2023-04-17T12:18:33Z

By the late 1970s, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) had duplicated the technology.  I am not familiar with IBMs implementation so the rest of my comments will apply to DEC.<br><br>It is important to understand that the underlying storage technology is one aspect and HOW THE DATA WAS ACCESSES is totally another !  On DEC machines, there as an extra &quot;layer&quot; added between the data and the application such that the data could be accessed via the primary or SECONDARY keys or sequentially !  While the primary key had to be unique, secondary keys did NOT have to be unique !!  The biggest problem was that no &quot;high level languages&quot; (Fortran, COBOL, C) supported this concept.  &quot;Extensions&quot; were added to each to support look up by primary or secondary keys.<br><br>As mentioned, there was no &quot;standard&quot; query language.  DEC invented Datatrieve.  It was a bit quirky but it included a &quot;report writer&quot;  similar in concept to IBM RPG which was immensely popular at the time.  The basic query could be written in Datatrieve and that could be linked into another custom application.<br><br>Sadly for DEC, ISAM never caught on in large volume.  It also could not scale horizontally without a lot of additional programming.  This was probably because it required proprietary language extensions.  Building &quot;forms&quot; for data entry was a sperate product or required a lot of programming.  As the world moved to &quot;windows&quot; based applications, DEC stayed in &quot;character cell&quot; interfaces as did IBM for much too long.  Microsoft Access was one of the biggest &quot;nails in the coffin&quot; for ISAM.  IBM and DEC had proprietary relational databases, but it was too Little to late.",2023-01-25T17:05:35Z

You can split a database into multiple smaller databases but then that just leads to higher maintenance costs. You could also have one just for writes and several others as read only databases but again this would need managing with the services accessing the databases.<br><br>With non relational yes you can throw into them what you want but unless you ‚Äúlock down‚Äù a schema for the data then you can‚Äôt get consistent results as each insert is a new entry rather than an ‚Äúupsert‚Äù.<br><br>I guess each have their pros and cons but you would choose whichever is best for your end system which you would know once you‚Äôve done the correct analysis,2023-05-05T21:04:50Z

I mean I watch this video and have exactly the same amount of information as before when not knowing anything about block storage... It&#39;s unclear where the differences are.. The differences I was able to take in the end is that &quot;block storage&quot; is greast if you have databases or clouds and file based storage let&#39;s you have shares and user access control... What about the physical aspects like disk? When I install mysql on my file storage, does it mean my sql database is then used the wrong way, or is there the possibility of using block storage inside file storage??? Is the block storage on special parts of the harddisks as only from block storage can be booted... What&#39;s hypervisor, why even mention it? Nothing gets explained here...

It is equivalent to data swamps as data stroed inside also can be inaccurate, duplicate or inaccurate data which can not be used for querying or for Business Intelligence.<br>In order to use this data, Data is cleaned first and then loaded into Data Warehouse through ETL process. It is easily queryable and can be used for BI and report generation. But it has two disadvantages :- <br>1. The cost of data warehouse is too high <br>2. Apps wants to consume fresh data may not get it from Data warehouse as it ETL process takes time to load data into warehoulse. <br>Hence to solve the shortcomings of both Data Lake and Data Warehouse, concept of data lakehouse is introduced",2023-09-09T13:41:41Z

E.g. if it&#39;s not &quot;found&quot; (not labelled so nobody knows what it is) and when it is recognized that it&#39;s a duplicate of something else are not the same things. In the first case you don&#39;t know what the value is, and in the 2nd case the actual/original data has the same value as before and the copy of it has no value.<br>- well, when it comes to have a lakehouse, the restaurant could force the supplier to dock at a special place to load ONLY vegetables or ONLY meat, so reducing the amount of &quot;labeling&quot; (obviously it has some additional costs to build different docks and certain restaurants (small ones) may not be able to afford that) so on the same way a data lake could apply some data warehouse &quot;principles&quot; to increase the structured-ness and the possibility of &quot;governance&quot;.<br>- It reminds me the sci-fi writer Stanislav Lem&#39;s novel where he describes how the wireless communication was &quot;invented&quot;: &quot;the engineers made the diameter of the wire by which the communication was done smaller... and then even smaller... and then a bit more... and at one point... there was no wire...&quot; üôÇ",2023-06-08T15:39:22Z

The location of the web server and the user shouldn&#39;t matter for accessing the website until and unless it is a region restricted website in which case you might require VPN. If the server is located in a geographically distant location then there might latency issues but accessibility should be fine.

Ur private ip address is not recognized by google so ur router does the talking to the internet. It is like a cell phone which allows u to talk to <a href=""http://google.so/"">google.So</a> ur private ip address is converted into the internet ipaddress with the help of net masking which u can see on seeing ifconfig which shows that ur private ip address is converted into the routers ip address. Basically when u buy internet connection you are buying an ipaddress that can talk to the world.Ur ISP has globally bought a range of ip address from IANA and it is giving u an ipaddress. So all the devices which access internet from ur home would actually be converted into the routers ip address in ur router and those packets are shoots up into the <a href=""http://net.so/"">net.So</a> ur router does the working of a postman when it receives reply from google and internally unmask the ipaddress to determine who was the person who send that request.",2020-06-21T02:03:15Z

For any IT system, there are many different ways to allocate functionality to deployable units - ie there is a sliding scale from one company-wide monolith to a handful of larger systems to many smaller systems to truly function-level components. Each different level of granularity has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal solution is likely to differ by business area - ie the optimal solution for a large system can well be a mix of components of different granularity. Very few large companies have a single monolith, and I doubt many companies use 100% fine-grained services either. Fine-grained components have some important advantages, but also some very nasty disadvantages. Moderate-grained components can potentially support elastic scaling without needing to be &quot;single functions&quot;. What is presented here are truly two extremes, and while the disadvantages of huge monoliths are presented, the (many) problems with truly fine-grained systems are not discussed at all.",2023-09-05T07:56:43Z

So, it&#39;s a more fully developed and ready to use solution offered to customers via a subscription model over the internet. Gmail and Salesforce would be two good SaaS examples.<br>FaaS on the other hand abstracts everything as well except the individual &quot;functions&quot;, actions, or pieces of the business logic that is managed by the customer. Outside of SaaS, FaaS has the highest level of abstraction at the smallest unit of scale which would be a function. So, with FaaS, a customer can break their application down into individual functions and upload them to a FaaS programing platform managed by a CSP where these functions will be triggered and executed when you need them. Also, FaaS is very cost effective as a customer only pays for the times that their functions get called instead of having to pay to have their application always on and waiting for requests like you would have to with PaaS.<br>I would recommend taking a look at some tutorials for our FaaS offering, IBM Cloud Functions, to learn more about FaaS üëâ <a href=""https://ibm.co/2YWwFvp"">https://ibm.co/2YWwFvp</a> <br>Hope this is helpful and thank you for your question!",2021-02-09T08:40:17Z

For any IT system, there are many different ways to allocate functionality to deployable units - ie there is a sliding scale from one company-wide monolith to a handful of larger systems to many smaller systems to truly function-level components. Each different level of granularity has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the optimal solution is likely to differ by business area - ie the optimal solution for a large system can well be a mix of components of different granularity. Very few large companies have a single monolith, and I doubt many companies use 100% fine-grained services either. Fine-grained components have some important advantages, but also some very nasty disadvantages. Moderate-grained components can potentially support elastic scaling without needing to be &quot;single functions&quot;. What is presented here are truly two extremes, and while the disadvantages of huge monoliths are presented, the (many) problems with truly fine-grained systems are not discussed at all.",2023-09-05T07:56:43Z

All of the &quot;gains&quot; here go away with the following simple design changes on the VM service side.<br><br>1) Use one VM per physical server.   Host OS and hypervisor overhead and costs become negligible.<br>2) Host multiple node instances as processes in a single VM.  They must be written so they can run without interfering with one another, but this is not difficult. A scheduler process can route incoming work to local processes.<br><br>That done, one can efficiently use the shared VM.   It&#39;s kind of silly to compare a terrible VM-based design with a sensible container-based one -- of course the sensible design works better.  To be clear there&#39;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with using containers -- if they&#39;re right for your application, great.  But virtually all of the amazing efficiency gains claimed here come from the unnecessarily poor architecture assumed on the VM side, not from some amazing improvements inherent in containers.",2022-03-10T21:28:00Z

I come from the mainframe performance monitoring area and academically I understand what observability definition is from control theory. Now I am facing all these new changes and digital transformations, specifically in the mainframe area, where I work as a Produt Manager. I am trying to learn these new concepts, but here are some observations:<br>-	The video starts by saying that APM, Monitoring, and Observability are different terms and then examines why? But you only discuss an Observavilty Solution instead<br>-	It seems that observability is primarily related to the Collection/generation of meaningful data. If this is entirely different than traditional monitoring, it is where the lines get fuzzy. Any monitoring solution (even monolithic) requires a sort of generation and collection of some kind of  data, analysis and action, so what&#39;s the difference?.<br>-	Also, when you build the 3 step process, you refer this as Observability Solution but do not explain what observability is?<br>-	 I think what is most important (please forgive me because I am learning this) is how you manage relations of the unpredictable distributed systems and applications (you mention this at the end)<br>-  Instana is the IBM observability solution, but there  is no clear distinction of the 3 terms (APM/Observability/Monitoring).<br>Thanks again, I enjoyed and learn a lot with your videos.",2021-07-13T00:31:48Z

Depending upon where Kubernetes is deployed, you can integrate with different load balancers that the infrastructure provides to expose pods as Services running on k8s. Different Service types take advantage of different networking patterns to access the pods running on the underlying infrastructure. NodePort-based Services leverage existing IP addresses of compute nodes and are accessed via a Node-level proxy. LoadBalancer-based Services create new Load Balancer instances and handle traffic directly through the infrastructure-based LoadBalancer. <br>So the answer to the question is ‚Äúit depends on how you want to access it‚Äù. üôÇ ",2021-06-09T13:36:18Z

What IBM is saying is the DevOps is just &quot;Development&quot; and SRE is &quot;Operations&quot; . They handoff the solutions/features to the SRE team and then they deploy them and monitor the solutions. This video is just creating the same silos but giving the teams fancier names.

But those unicorns companies that do, they need to look cool and shiney and attract the best skilled employees for years to come to take care of those datacenters. So what do they do ? They invent new TLD&#39;s, wrote books, essays, conventions. create a hype. When basically its the same old gig of Operations people just slightly smarter as we are dealing with the cloud after all. But hey, its a new title, new budgets.<br><br>Why would they care that in 99% of the companes this creates a secondary IT organization  or a shadow IT ?

Conventional PCs are something that you can with have a lot of freedom and flexibility. Essentially you can do whatever you want with your PC - re-program it, install software on it, play with it... However an edge computing device is something that is more likely administered by a central service provider (i.e. Amazon Alexa offered by Amazon) that you cannot easily tamper with, but it does have enough processing power to do many things locally rather than always having to talk to the Cloud. A prime example is a self-driving car. A self-driving Tesla is an epitome an &quot;edge computer&quot; which drives your car without having talking to the Cloud - and quite conceivably so. Moreover, a Tesla self-driving car receives upgrades from Tesla every once in a while - a sign of being administered by Tesla. Last but not least, you can&#39;t re-program a Tesla to let it ignore pedestrians in front of itself otherwise it&#39;d become a really cheap assassin... Hope it helps.",2020-06-17T23:52:32Z

Where does the edge computing perform i.e in edge device itself or in edge server. If it performs the computing in edge servers then in the case of autonomous vehicles we cant expect continuous network connection because of its mobility. So in this case if the network connection is lost then how can the edge server communicate with that autonomous vehicle.,2019-12-26T18:00:15Z

All of the &quot;gains&quot; here go away with the following simple design changes on the VM service side.<br><br>1) Use one VM per physical server.   Host OS and hypervisor overhead and costs become negligible.<br>2) Host multiple node instances as processes in a single VM.  They must be written so they can run without interfering with one another, but this is not difficult. A scheduler process can route incoming work to local processes.<br><br>That done, one can efficiently use the shared VM.   It&#39;s kind of silly to compare a terrible VM-based design with a sensible container-based one -- of course the sensible design works better.  To be clear there&#39;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with using containers -- if they&#39;re right for your application, great.  But virtually all of the amazing efficiency gains claimed here come from the unnecessarily poor architecture assumed on the VM side, not from some amazing improvements inherent in containers.",2022-03-10T21:28:00Z

Depending upon where Kubernetes is deployed, you can integrate with different load balancers that the infrastructure provides to expose pods as Services running on k8s. Different Service types take advantage of different networking patterns to access the pods running on the underlying infrastructure. NodePort-based Services leverage existing IP addresses of compute nodes and are accessed via a Node-level proxy. LoadBalancer-based Services create new Load Balancer instances and handle traffic directly through the infrastructure-based LoadBalancer. <br>So the answer to the question is ‚Äúit depends on how you want to access it‚Äù. üôÇ ",2021-06-09T13:36:18Z

While both are cloud technologies offered by RedHat, OpenStack is IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) and OpenShift is PaaS (Platform as a service).<br>PaaS (e.g. OpenShift) allows the cloud providers to transform their servers into cloud, by hosting networks, storage, operating system software, middleware, databases, etc. at their data centers. Also, PaaS is often built around containers, a virtualized compute model one step removed from virtual servers. PaaS is a newer model of cloud computing.<br>IaaS (e.g. OpenStack) provides on-demand access to fundamental computing resources (physical and virtual servers, networking, and storage) over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis. Users are able to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis. Also, IaaS does not use containers. In contrast to PaaS, IaaS provides the users with the lowest-level control of computing resources in the cloud.<br>You can read more in this blog by RedHat üëâ <a href=""https://ibm.co/3jH6CD8"">https://ibm.co/3jH6CD8</a><br>Hope this helps! üôÇ ",2021-10-27T09:51:37Z

Usually this involves communicating over the network between servers and other networked devices. I often find myself playing the middle-man between the sysadmins and the software development team. I&#39;ve toyed around with Ansible on a handful of occasions. Each time, I found simpler ways to solve my problems by just writing my own Python script or library and doing away with Ansible altogether. I can&#39;t say that a proficient Javascript developer who knows only a little Python would have the same experience. They might find Ansible very handy, so I wouldn&#39;t say that Ansible is the wrong choice in all cases, but Python is extremely powerful in its own right. If you know Python well, and don&#39;t work on a massive team, you probably don&#39;t need Ansible. In my experience, incorporating Ansible just meant having more to maintain that wasn&#39;t really needed. I think the benefit of Ansible starts to become noticeable when other sysadmins who aren&#39;t developers start needing to utilize the tools you&#39;ve built in Python. Even so, many sysadmins today know Python just about as well as they know bash because it is so suitable for that line of work. Most of my perspective comes from the fact that I take a very minimalist approach to the development process. The less third-party frameworks I am forced to rely on, the better. I&#39;m usually at my happiest and the least stressed when every module in my script if from the standard library. At my last contract position, we chose to use paramiko which is a simple SSH library for Python, rather than a full-blown automation framework. It worked exceptionally well, and we actually wrote some pretty robust internal automation libraries on top of paramiko.",2023-12-19T10:40:08Z

Comment: Tuning or doping ( depending how you look at it), can easily skew the outcome and performance with faulty containment. Anyone who doubts that should look at the past 3 years, globally. I would love to take some US government stats that are suspect by many and feed in some independent data sources (factual and unbiased) and see what the splinters are between artificial constructed narratives versus true trustworthy outcomes leading to better public policy. I would much rather have data from &quot;decentralized sources like substack than any centralized entity with forced feed. Centralized and curated data is very suspect as these sources lack standing up under any scrutinized trained mind. Data decays rapidly as does public sentiment. Value systems do not decay hat easily.  Many sources are found to be corrupt and full of false details/poor assumptions. I would take COVID-19 and so-called Climate Change into that scenario and showcase the delta&#39;s that would exist based on the tuning or the doping schemes injected into these models and then presented to the public as either falsehood, truth &amp; fact. Lots of inconvenient truths will emerge IMHO. Lots. Furthermore, my prediction ( no AI )  is that &quot;smart&quot; trial lawyers are going to find these bread crumbs into these models and be able to pull them apart in discovery where cases of injury, unlawfulness or unfairness was the outcome impacting individuals or whole communities. So the tuning and doping schemes will need to be explained likely under oath and in the courts.",2023-07-26T20:41:21Z

So what you want to show is that every change is reviewed (often a code review) and good efforts are put in place to govern change. So where the auditor might look for an approval from the QA Management on quality in a traditional environment, in a CD environment, you show that appropriate leaders approved test coverage and test success benchmarks and that each build going into production has a record of having cleared those benchmarks. You show that you&#39;ve automated what used to be manual controls. <br><br>Given SOC 2&#39;s emphasis on security, I think that second pair of eyes on every change (fraud requires conspiracy, not a single actor) and evidence of security testing would have a good chance.

You program the API with a programming language SDK.  In summary, the SDK helps you to build the API.  Now you can always use the raw elements provided by a programming language to build the API, but an SDK helps you get there faster by &quot;packaging&quot; capabilities into one subset of operations.  For instance, think of Node.JS and Express.  You can build a WebServer with paths and methods to make a REST API always.  Think of Express.js as a SDK Framework, that will help you get there faster by &quot;pre-configuring&quot; some functionality for you.

I mean we are adding probably a presentation layer inside the logic before passing the response data to the client.

It&#39;s basically a centralized place where an organization stores all their different data, allowing for many types of analytics at a larger scale (e.g social media data).<br>While a data pipeline is a system that filters these large amounts of data in order to provide a more concise and insightful set of analytics to the organization. It is used for more efficient and detailed reporting and it serves a specific purpose.<br>Hope this answers your question! üôÇ ",2021-07-05T12:27:24Z

AI is, at least currently, a an application of ML, rather than ML being a subset of AI. This is because currently, what we describe as AI is built upon ML. I would even argue that right now, all AI uses ML, but not all ML could be considered AI. I would also argue that AI, at least a true AI capable of understanding and/or exhibiting anything that can be considered intelligence, does not currently exist and likely never will exist using traditional computing technologies as ultimately current methods are no more than complex algorithms. Anyone who says that current AI applications are unpredictable are only half correct. From a practical point of view, this is true, however they are ultimately still calculations based upon mathematical formulas and digital logic, which could be predicted/replicated manually given enough time and resources. I would further argue that what is currently considered AI is at best a simulated intelligence, which is supported by the fact that current AI&#39;s are unreliable in most applications. I will not say that AI is impossible, and in fact I believe that we may eventually get close even with traditional computing technologies, however a true AI is likely impossible without quantum computing.",2023-12-07T12:18:28Z

The reason why I found your video is I was looking for information about AI because Tesla just released FSD 12 which they say is now AI and not programming. So I was trying to understand what that means exactly. They are saying that Tesla&#39;s AI has watched hundreds of millions of miles of humans driving to learn how to drive. What worries me is that many humans have very bad habits when they&#39;re driving. How do they keep the AI for learning the bad habits? What do you think of Tesla&#39;s FSD 12?

From what I&#39;ve read and heard is that in the beginning FSD 12 will have some hiccups but over the long run will be much better and I heard it&#39;s going to be much easier for them to scale. This sounds good. I think overall the FSD is going to be much safer than the average driver. I think the biggest problem with drivers today is distracted driving texting and things. Also people that want to go out and drink their car can take them home. Lol. Thank you for your answer I appreciate it. üëç,2023-11-26T23:32:16Z

All these difficulties come from the fear that we, under the subliminal influence of Generative Marketing, are losing the cognitive ability because of the naming mess all around us (so not only around ML and AI). <br>Pattern Parroting (ML) has its inherent limits. The humankind jumped in the intelligence era when it started to translate his instinctive and parroting knowledge into formal knowledge  (classification, category, logical inferences...) . The limits of what they today call AI lie in the fact that the model cannot produce anything close to formal knowledge (cognitive ability, formal logic inference, etc). In conclusion, imho, if this is AI then it is a dead-end parroting AI.<br>There&#39;s what can be called parroting intelligence, and there&#39;s symbolic logic intelligence. Bridging the two seems as difficult as defining anew knowledge in terms of symbolic logic. <br>(what could be read as irony is to be interpreted as resorting to coloured terms for the sake of brevity).",2023-10-13T18:14:30Z

This feature supports both uni-directional and bi-directional streaming.<br><br>Backwards compatibility. One of the foundational reasons for gRPC‚Äôs inception was to avoid API breaking updates for new features. For example, imagine you have a bunch of client applications using a 1.0 iteration of your proto definition but your server upgrades to a 2.0 definition. In most other communication apis, all client applications would have to update to comply. However with gRPC this is not necessary, new fields are simply ignored by older client implementations. The key rule being you must keep legacy fields in proto files in the same place (the numbers in proto files dictate the position in the binary structure along with the size of the field).<br><br>Another really nice feature of gRPC is the ability for multiple gRPC services to bind to the same server socket. This does require a single server process for this methodology but is useful for micro services that may need to provide multiple rpc calls. (No need to allocate a range of ports for services). <br><br>Hope this info helps someone jump into gRPC!

Modern APIs support upgrades with versioning.  Multiple versions are supported simultaneously.  Examples are, JDK and HTTP.  There&#39;s also nothing special about gRPC&#39;s binary serialization. CORBA has done the same thing since the early 1990&#39;s. gRPC is just a stripped down version of CORBA.  Like CORBA, gRPC is a least common denominator approach, which means it causes the same impedance mismatches that JSON does.  gRPC exists because Google has the typical &quot;not invented here&quot; bias. gRPC is supported by the likes of IBM, so they can rent out expensive consultants to clueless corporate IT groups.  gRPC will follow that same fateful path as CORBA, SOAP and XML-RPC.

However, I wanted also discuss about activation function so the formula you used is - (x1*w1)+(x2*w2)+(x3w3)-threshold. As I understood the threshold is a biggest number used, so that&#39;s why you took number 5? Also our w2 is equals to 0, so if the w2 even would be 999999999 (like for us it is super important to be fit) the answer for whole equation would still be positive. So this is my concern about formula if w2 id more prevalent than other options, why in any possible situation we are only capable to have the answer YES ORDER PIZZA. and even x1 and x2 would be 0, but x3=1, with w1 and w2 equaled to 899796 or any other big number we will still get positive outcome. This really baffled me, so I would happy to read your response!",2023-06-10T10:27:59Z

You need to use many, many environments in parallel, the risk of messing up with incompatible dependencies is very high, until you found out a balance between packages you need and work (in a specific version!) with each other. Can be a nightmare.  R is compared to that robust. If at all, you need to extend a function with :: and the name of the library, and your done.",2023-05-22T23:21:34Z

Yes, tidyverse is superior to Pandas, but only as long as you hard-code your variables. Yes, there are more statistical functions for R than for Python, but Python is catching up fast. I use statsmodels and, at least in my work, it can do anything an R library could. R is easier to use for elementary tasks, like performing a t-test (it&#39;s a one-liner in R), but as soon as you do something more complex, it is easy to get lost in R. Similar for graphics: Basic plotting is easier in R, but, to get the plot look as <i>you</i> want it (as opposed to &#39;as the computer wants it&#39;), Matplotlib and Seaborn beat ggplot any day. Python is easy, logical, systematic, orthogonal, elegant...

There is some doubt it can perform as well as Oracle In-Memory however SAP is not certifying Oracle for S/4 for example. There is anecdotal evidence that Oracle in-memory outperforms Hana. Hana is being promoted by one of the largest software companies and can therefore afford to drown out any criticism by virtue of its size and volume of promotional information. However the truth is SAP is using its monopoly in the ERP market to sell a database without allowing any other database to compete in the same arena. Sounds a bit like monopolistic practices to me. I don&#39;t work for any database manufacturer or software vendor. I know a fair bit about SAP.,2019-02-25T01:46:47Z

Here is what Bradley had to say: SAP HANA is an ultra-high speed in-memory databased designed to work as the back end for a number of different applications: ERP applications, Business Warehouse applications, CRM applications, and others. Product suites from SAP like S/4 HANA and BW/4 HANA incorporate the applications themselves along with the database, allowing companies to have better insight into their core ERP and BW data. So, while HANA is similar to a Data Warehouse, it&#39;s designed more for real-time intelligence than a traditional data warehouse would be.",2019-01-08T20:17:29Z

Python‚Äôs lack of extensibility has forced, for example, multiple projects to write their own custom NumPy implementations from scratch (e.g. jax.numpy). The basic problem is that in Python there is no way to extend a given function onto a type that you don‚Äôt own. This extensibility is one of the prime selling points of Julia.<br><br>In fact, the most recent criticism of Julia that sparked a lot of discussion was that Julia is <i>too</i> extensible and that the culture of extensibility has led to correctness bugs in popular third party libraries.<br><br>I think the point you were making wasn‚Äôt necessarily about extensibility but how ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù each language is. On the continuum of ‚Äúall functionality needs to be imported‚Äù (Python lives around here) to ‚Äúall functionality is in the base language‚Äù (MATLAB lives around here), Julia is pretty decidedly on the Python side. The one notable difference is that Julia‚Äôs arrays have a concept of dimensionality baked in, so matrices and higher-dimension arrays are part of the core language. Personally, I‚Äôm a fan, because NumPy is hamstrung into some pretty clunky syntax around matrices. And it‚Äôs nice to not have to care about the difference between a list and a numpy.array. But I think those are more personal preferences. People seem to like NumPy, so I won‚Äôt tell them they‚Äôre wrong.<br><br>I‚Äôll note one last difference in that community in Python and Julia mean different things. In Python, community is generally a one-way street. You can search a question and almost always find an answer someone gave at some point in time. In Julia, you won‚Äôt always find a lot of answers by searching, but you can hop on the Discourse, Slack, Zulip, etc. and very quickly get an answer, as the community is very active. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Julia‚Äôs approach certainly isn‚Äôt going to scale well as the user base grows, but for now it feels kinda nice. The people who most often answer your questions tend to be working on similar problems as you, so industry-specific connections kinda happen naturally.",2023-10-24T13:03:25Z

I have been using Scilab (a free Matlab alternative) for years, and IDL/PVWAVE before that. I am finding the transition to Julia very smooth. I actually don&#39;t mind the type annotations, especially for the speed gained. It is pretty much mandatory if you wish to input data into certain functions. In Julia you need to be careful about assigning variables to other variables, if you don&#39;t want to change those as well - this can lead to unexpected bugs you can lose hours with :)",2023-05-18T17:48:42Z

Python is better in general: larger community by order of magnitude at least, even more active users and package for everything. I basically use OpenCV, Pillow (image processing or just basics), Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy. Maybe Cairo, Curl ... sometimes. But Python is basically calling C++ code here. Doing number crunching directly in Python is horrible idea.It&#39;s like two orders of magnitude slower than C++ while Julia is maybe twice or three times slower? Unless you use AVX intrinsic instructions in C++ which can make single core performance 5 times better than C++.<br>Also I tried Julia maybe two years ago for one week, but I haven&#39;t found a comfortable way how to split 1000 lines of code into files.

The decision making process for multi-tenancy usually comes down to the security requirements and the level of multi-tenancy being requested. Security is usually down to the isolation at the hardware level, or even storage level depending on your needs. If you need physical separation then single tenancy is the better route to proceed, if it is acceptable to share compute/storage using ACLS to isolate different users/customers then multi-tenancy is a better route. For the level of multi-tenancy, this can range from bare metal or to a software instance eg Share physical database server, but running development / testing intances.   --Bryan",2019-11-05T19:35:41Z

After some time i came to realization that what scientists call a &quot;superposition&quot; is in fact immensely fast oscillation (switching of states between 0 and 1) of physical particle which embodies the qubit abstraction properties. This would also support the fact that when a qubit is read - it is always 0 or 1 - because a &quot;snapshot&quot; in time is taken of the qubit state. Scientists call this the &quot;collapse&quot; of state to either 0 or 1.  I have also read that this qubit abstraction could be represented in real world by several different types of particles. So a Hadamard gate would be a piece of hardware that would put this particle into an oscillatory state? If anyone could clarify this to me. Also i would be immensely interested to know how Gates work, how would be possible to encode a typical classic information theory problem into the qubit world and use the construction of quantum circuits to solve it. Also some physics how it is possible to entangle 2 particles that maintains their coherence. How interference work. So some ideas for next video topic maybe? Thank you.",2022-05-27T15:27:47Z

AI can also automate security processes, helping to reduce the time and effort needed to detect and respond to threats. Finally, AI can be used to detect and prevent malicious attacks before they can cause any damage. AI can also be used to identify and respond to new threats faster than traditional security processes. AI can continuously monitor for new security threats and alert system administrators when they are detected. As a result, organizations can be confident their systems are secure and up to date with the latest security protocols, protecting their data and applications from malicious actors. For instance, AI can identify unusual patterns in user behavior, flagging any suspicious activity for further investigation by security analysts. <br><br>One concern with using AI for security is that it can create a false sense of security. If administrators rely too heavily on AI to secure their systems, they may become complacent and overlook other potential security threats. Additionally, AI-based security systems are not foolproof and can be fooled by sophisticated attackers. AI-based security systems provide improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional security solutions.

LLMs in particular are exceptional at figuring out relationships/sequences between things and then inferring likely/expected relationships when applied to new data (in the wild). Model training is an iterative process where the model loops back on its own mathematical logic (backpropagation) by self-tuning its own parameters (things called weights, biases, and other jargon) and then checking its output again and again to see if it improved. This optimization then stops (converges) when it cannot optimize itself anymore (aka reduces its loss function). So, your model may end up at say 90% accuracy.  If that is enough for your needs you are ready to deploy that model on new data it has never seen before (inference).  But, if 90% was not good enough, you try a new model or add a couple hidden layers or feed it more data, lots of options. This is conceptually how most all neural networks work. So, you would likely hone in on an outlier amongst the predicted outputs/acceptable patterns to localize anomalous behavior and then look at that event&#39;s connections to trace it back to a possible cause.

Machine.<br><br>Patent law provides for free or low cost technology, they expire or owners can charge little or nothing.<br><br>Creating open source however, has relied on copy right law, which is a no no.  It has violated copy right law, which provides unconditional transformative copy writes, a power Congress reserved, to create more, not free intellectual property.<br><br>So then open source is one of two things, patentable, or not.  If not, it is free anyway.  If it is patentable, but you do not patent it, that is called patent abandonment of your &#39;discovery&#39;.<br><br>We can also go to the most basic levels of patent law and say a cpu unit and hardware are so general purpose, that software can not be patentable since there is no other way to run the machine, but by eventually duplicating the code of others, even if working independently.<br><br>I have no way of knowing that can or will happen.   The results of ignoring these concepts has damaged economies, as software not being run through a patent office, has cost people time and money trying to run machines with broken drivers, software and bugs.<br><br>AI?  AI now stands for Automated Intellectual property theft?  Where are the foot notes depicting source data?

The decision making process for multi-tenancy usually comes down to the security requirements and the level of multi-tenancy being requested. Security is usually down to the isolation at the hardware level, or even storage level depending on your needs. If you need physical separation then single tenancy is the better route to proceed, if it is acceptable to share compute/storage using ACLS to isolate different users/customers then multi-tenancy is a better route. For the level of multi-tenancy, this can range from bare metal or to a software instance eg Share physical database server, but running development / testing intances.   --Bryan",2019-11-05T19:35:41Z

After some time i came to realization that what scientists call a &quot;superposition&quot; is in fact immensely fast oscillation (switching of states between 0 and 1) of physical particle which embodies the qubit abstraction properties. This would also support the fact that when a qubit is read - it is always 0 or 1 - because a &quot;snapshot&quot; in time is taken of the qubit state. Scientists call this the &quot;collapse&quot; of state to either 0 or 1.  I have also read that this qubit abstraction could be represented in real world by several different types of particles. So a Hadamard gate would be a piece of hardware that would put this particle into an oscillatory state? If anyone could clarify this to me. Also i would be immensely interested to know how Gates work, how would be possible to encode a typical classic information theory problem into the qubit world and use the construction of quantum circuits to solve it. Also some physics how it is possible to entangle 2 particles that maintains their coherence. How interference work. So some ideas for next video topic maybe? Thank you.",2022-05-27T15:27:47Z

AI can also automate security processes, helping to reduce the time and effort needed to detect and respond to threats. Finally, AI can be used to detect and prevent malicious attacks before they can cause any damage. AI can also be used to identify and respond to new threats faster than traditional security processes. AI can continuously monitor for new security threats and alert system administrators when they are detected. As a result, organizations can be confident their systems are secure and up to date with the latest security protocols, protecting their data and applications from malicious actors. For instance, AI can identify unusual patterns in user behavior, flagging any suspicious activity for further investigation by security analysts. <br><br>One concern with using AI for security is that it can create a false sense of security. If administrators rely too heavily on AI to secure their systems, they may become complacent and overlook other potential security threats. Additionally, AI-based security systems are not foolproof and can be fooled by sophisticated attackers. AI-based security systems provide improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional security solutions.

LLMs in particular are exceptional at figuring out relationships/sequences between things and then inferring likely/expected relationships when applied to new data (in the wild). Model training is an iterative process where the model loops back on its own mathematical logic (backpropagation) by self-tuning its own parameters (things called weights, biases, and other jargon) and then checking its output again and again to see if it improved. This optimization then stops (converges) when it cannot optimize itself anymore (aka reduces its loss function). So, your model may end up at say 90% accuracy.  If that is enough for your needs you are ready to deploy that model on new data it has never seen before (inference).  But, if 90% was not good enough, you try a new model or add a couple hidden layers or feed it more data, lots of options. This is conceptually how most all neural networks work. So, you would likely hone in on an outlier amongst the predicted outputs/acceptable patterns to localize anomalous behavior and then look at that event&#39;s connections to trace it back to a possible cause.

Kerberos and PAM<br>Currently, kerberized services do not make use of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) ‚Äî kerberized servers bypass PAM completely. However, applications that use PAM can make use of Kerberos for authentication if the pam_krb5 module (provided in the pam_krb5 package) is installed. The pam_krb5 package contains sample configuration files that allow services like login and gdm to authenticate users as well as obtain initial credentials using their passwords. If access to network servers is always performed using kerberized services or services that use GSS-API, such as IMAP, the network can be considered reasonably safe.<br><br>Note<br>Administrators should be careful to not allow users to authenticate to most network services using Kerberos passwords. Many protocols used by these services do not encrypt the password before sending it over the network, destroying the benefits of the Kerberos system. For example, users should not be allowed to authenticate using their Kerberos passwords over Telnet.",2022-09-27T12:56:01Z

Looked at it this way, zero trust doesn&#39;t look so draconian.

You want everyone to come to your website and browse freely if you are selling something - but you want a solid guarantee of identity if they have a purchasing account with you: so different parts of your application may well have very different levels of security from  total  trust to zero trust,  Granularity is key, and must be designed into the application from the outset.

Kerberos and PAM<br>Currently, kerberized services do not make use of Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) ‚Äî kerberized servers bypass PAM completely. However, applications that use PAM can make use of Kerberos for authentication if the pam_krb5 module (provided in the pam_krb5 package) is installed. The pam_krb5 package contains sample configuration files that allow services like login and gdm to authenticate users as well as obtain initial credentials using their passwords. If access to network servers is always performed using kerberized services or services that use GSS-API, such as IMAP, the network can be considered reasonably safe.<br><br>Note<br>Administrators should be careful to not allow users to authenticate to most network services using Kerberos passwords. Many protocols used by these services do not encrypt the password before sending it over the network, destroying the benefits of the Kerberos system. For example, users should not be allowed to authenticate using their Kerberos passwords over Telnet.",2022-09-27T12:56:01Z

So, this is quite a broad question. In brief, where BPM (Business Process Management) is a strategic approach to develop, run, continuously optimize and manage any type of business processes that might span even through different organizations and engage several different user roles, RPA is more tactical solution to automate manual tasks that business users normally do in their own desktop environment using different applications and their user interfaces - like reporting, gathering data from different sources, handling and matching invoices, just to mention few of them.

I am an Avocado Farmer using edge systems that are located at the site.  Many of the sites that comprise Avocado fields are located on sites where cell phone connections are required and cell phone data rates are at the ragged edge (enough to read the wireless electric meters).  Since the control system has to be 7/24, control and processing have to be done at the edge.  Moving data up to the cloud is not ideal as the work at the edge has to be duplicated at the cloud as well the cell phone cost in moving data the data to the cloud<br><br>The processing at the edge is micro-service-based processing much like the cloud.  As with the cloud, MQTT data inputs are going to be put in Kafka-like structures ( at the edge these structures would be represented by Redis, Postgres, or Influxdb data sources) for application processing.  There would be a great advantage in tapping into these streams by the cloud so that aggregation of site data could be done at the cloud and control operation be done at the edge.  Data traffic on the cellular network would be reduced as only aggregate data be returned instead of bulk data.  So rather than tapping into bulk data, one is tapping into the microservice stream much like a local environment<br><br>Can the data idea fabric be applied to this type of environment?  If it can it would solve a lot of problems.  I worked on and my friend still does where as many as a thousand units are in retail chains.  Since the mid &#39;90s&#39; we have not been able to solve this problem very well.<br><br><br>Either way, I am grateful for this video.  This video gave me a new word.  ( The IBM Edge Video gave me a keyword, with the definition of an Edge system being a computer at the edge that runs containers with the free capacity to run applications that are normally done at the edge.)  Been trying to convey a processing architecture for 5 years and the right words allow the concepts to be more easily conveyed<br><br>Again thank you",2021-09-17T20:41:55Z

I would start by defining a dictionary of themes or categories you expect to find in the text. Let\s say the project is food related. One theme could be fried food. &quot;Fried&quot;, &quot;battered&quot;, &quot;Kentucky&quot;, &quot;fish &amp; chips&quot;, &quot;onion rings&quot;, &quot;tempura&quot;, &quot;crispy&quot;, &quot;panko&quot; could be some of many key terms to flag a paragraph, comment, or whatever unit of partition as involving fried food. From there, you could further divide entries flagged as fried into subcategories of good or bad. First you use an easy general classifer. Words like &quot;disgusting&quot; or &quot;nasty&quot; would automatically be flagged as negative connotation, while terms like &quot;tasty&quot; or &quot;mouth-watering&quot; would be flagged as good. The best part is that this general good/bad keyword set is applicable to all your other food types. But even further, we could make a fried.sentiment keyword set specifically built to pick up anything we may have missed. &quot;greasy&quot; could be neutral, so in fried.sentiment we would have &quot;too greasy&quot; as a negative flag but &quot;greasy goodness&quot; or &quot;nice and greasy&quot; as a positive flag. You could event assign a scoring mechanism for large documents so that the total number of good/bad flags is tallied. Only when the number of good and bad flags is nearly even would you have to take the time to line by line examine the particular doc.",2023-10-09T22:41:06Z

If i understand it right: The type of quantum algorithm used decides what kind of geometrical problem is being solved? For example the nearest points? And the 2 points are analogues to public and private keys? So once a person has one of the 2 points it is easy to find out nearest point to the initial one? And vice versa.

In following context, I recognize system as  a collection of organized elements (here SW, HW, and logical connections, algorithms)  created  in order to find solution for certain problem. Based on IBM experience and expertise it will be very useful to see how such systems are deployed (simplified architecture, without details which can be given later in comment section). Less text more hand made sketches . It will be great also to see general attitude (exemplification) in solving current complex humanity problems by use of SW and HW.   More awesome to incorporate scientific and research domain and depict how the SW, HW can contribute in those domains. For me the channel should be not only informative but mostly play educational role and give inspiration for the subscribers.

How well a time series model performs and how risky it is to use  time series methods will depend on the field of study. A TS model may produce very good results in a natural science problem but disastrous results in a finance problem. It all boils down to a basic understanding of statistics. If your data is not being generated by a controlled experiment then be highly cautious in terms of causality and forecasting.,2022-02-05T22:41:45Z

After taking a detailed look at the Blackjack problem, I don&#39;t think there is a need for any tutorial on it. The problem itself is quite simple. if you do &quot;return player_total &lt; 15&quot;, you will get a win rate of ~42%. Given that blackjack between 1 person and dealer is a lot of luck, its not possible to get a better win rate.

In the Indian currency, it cost me 700Rs just for the book and when I opened it the pages started popping out of the book. Also, the margin on the pages is on the wrong side which led to text getting buried in the Glued side. Although I had read it completely previously and had the soft copy still I ordered it with sheer respect.

I am sure will definitely get matured enough to handle almost all kind of problems reading your book, but just wanted to know if there is any specific section dedicated to it. Also, it would be of immense help to a lot of people if you make a youtube video specifically dedicated to working on imbalance data, there are a lot of questions we students always have in mind about this kind of problem, the very first one is what performance can we expect while learning a skewed data, for example, one with the probability of class 0 being 0.9 and class 1 is 0.1 as most of the classic ML algos don&#39;t do well on such data its looks bit hopeless sometimes.",2020-06-01T12:49:14Z

They are much appreciated as you go trough all the steps of the DL training process, and thus explain all concepts which often a given from granted. <br>I have a question though. it seems to me that you don&#39;t fine tune the pre-trained language model to the corpus of data you&#39;re using for the Q&amp;A downstream task. <br>Don&#39;t you think such a step, suggested by Jeremy Howard will benefit the performance of the model, especially for corpus of text used in a specific domain (i.e. education, movie reviews, politics or whatever). More specifically, when tokens of the this new corpus of data are not included in the <b>*vocab*</b> file of Bert, they are encoded as &quot;[UNK]&quot; token, right? I am wondering what would happen if these &quot;[UNK]&quot;  tokens get increasingly high. <br>(I know that Bert tokenizer separates words in small chunks, but say we have an Albert vocab obtained with Sentencepiece tokenizer). <br>So, one solution proposed by Howard is to update the pre-trained model so that it also includes the tokens specific to the new context and train them in a few steps before training the model for the downstream tasks. <br>Do you agree on such a solution (I mean have you ever tried), and is there a  simple way to implement it for Bert(ology) models? <br>Thanks you in advance. ;)",2020-06-22T16:58:22Z

I&#39;m an avid learner and more of a hands-on guy and so when I watch a video it is either to learn something at a slower pace or to see action (like demonstration). For example, when I watched your video (and I watched till end), I was expecting you to demonstrate the trained model in form of a small application over something. I also know it might not have been possible in a short 30 minutes video if you&#39;re making it for a specific target group; I guess a simple disclaimer before the start of video would&#39;ve helped really well.<br><br>For example,<br>Hi Youtube, today I&#39;ll be showing you how to setup an arbitrary code to perform training of BERT classifier from scratch.

So let&#39;s get started....<br><br>I apologize if I came out as arrogant or mean, but to be honest, I&#39;ve practically learned whole coding from internet (and had implemented a simple OS for my final year project as well); so I kind of felt like telling you because other people like me can fall for the same.<br><br>Thank you",2020-08-15T20:18:11Z

If so, what would be a practical way of dealing with such scenarios. I mean ideally, test data is never available to us while training.

One slight question tho; I&#39;m new to ML &amp; SD so I don&#39;t understand everything in detail. What we train here; &quot;pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors&quot; is just a LORA weight right? not a full checkpoint. (since the size is also very small) - I&#39;ve copied this file into &quot;loras&quot; directory in comfy-ui, set the base model as sdxl and load this one as lora, however it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything when I prompt &quot;sks man&quot;, I just get a random image and hundreds of &quot;lora key not loaded unet.up_blocks.1.attentions.2.transformer_blocks.1...........&quot;  errors - is this not supposed to work as standalone lora?",2023-07-28T20:07:15Z

Wouldn‚Äôt it be more suitable to split the train data into train / val and then optimize the hyper parameters individually for each fold (nested CV) ?,2022-02-01T13:32:05Z

So you know one of the things that made Colab pretty famous the so-called TPUs. Well, the thing is that I was looking for a tutorial on using TPUs on Colab for Computer-Vision with custom data. In my research for a whole week what I found related to the topic is the following:<br>1) The already existing tutorial is on MNIST (like really, who uses MNITS for TPUs?)<br>2) The MNIST or similar datasets used for those tutorials are already stored in the tfds and hence were in some Google Cloud Storage bucket which makes them easy to use for TPUs.&#39;<br>3) There were examples of some NLP using TPUs but as the NLP data is much smaller in size and hence could be loaded within the session but such is not the case with Image data.<br>4) In the case of custom data your whole Dataset should be on a GCS bucket as only that is registered for TPU training. (for computer vision)<br>5) So while training your dataset is supposed to read the data directly from the bucket and feed to the TPU.<br><br>I didn&#39;t find a single tutorial that shows how to do this. I tried it to some extend by myself by uploading my image data to GCS and was even able to read in the colab but in the end, I got some errors in the execution of the model. here is the StackOverflow question I posted regarding that - <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68355793/unimplimented-error-while-training-on-tpu-in-colab"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68355793/unimplimented-error-while-training-on-tpu-in-colab</a><br><br>With these things in mind, I truly request you to make a tutorial on that.",2021-07-13T11:12:02Z

Time!  If you like something make sure you are giving most of your time to be good at it.<br>2. Show your work and team up with others.<br>3. Understand the problem statement, build on skills and  in long run it will help to translate ideas from one domain to another. Hello transfer learning!<br>4. Overview on where do boosting / neural net dominate <br>5. Have local validation at 5 fold ( Train on 80% data and inferring out of the rest) but when you are submitting you don&#39;t take ensemble of the model but what you do is just remember hyperparameters that work(15 epochs etc ).  5 models trained on 100 % of data is better than 5 models trained on 80% of data. It increases score by 10 %<br>6. If you are starting out -  Kaggle Kernals/ Google Colab is sufficient to work with along GPU<br>7. Learn from others and implement your own ideas rather than forking and submitting kernels written by others.<br>8. We all deal with Imposter syndrome in some way. You learn most when you learn little bit each day<br><br>Happy Kaggling! <br><br><br>Love",2021-06-26T08:49:40Z

So I was amazed all the time I heard that from him, so I did everything he said only to see that at the very day which he said I will be cured and should go for a test to confirm my status, I went to hospital for the final test and the doctor after running the test said I&#39;m HIV Negative wow.

A few issues:   At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaCFd-vL4HA&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a>, I see what you&#39;re trying to do here: shuffle the input data.  But this is not the best way to shuffle your data.  Instead, consider using the <br>`model_selection.StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=2020)`  method from the sklearn library.<br>Instead, use the `shuffle=True` argument inside the StratifiedKFold() method.   Why?   Because then you can also specify the `random_state=42` argument (or whatever random integer you choose).  This has the advantage of making your random split invariant each time you run your script.   This will help you immensely when it comes to reproducing your dataset split, and thus will also aid you in any downstream debugging, since this way you&#39;ll be using precisely the exact same split of data each time.  It&#39;s one less source of variability in your pipeline, which always helps when hunting down pesky bugs.",2020-06-13T11:53:02Z

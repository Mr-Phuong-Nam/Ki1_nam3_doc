If you&#39;re looking to start a career in data engineering, it&#39;s important to focus on the core skills and knowledge required for the role. While some data engineering positions may require knowledge of statistics or machine learning, these skills are not typically the primary focus of a data engineering role.<br><br>Here are the key skills and knowledge areas that are important for a data engineering career:<br><br>1. **Programming Skills**: Strong programming skills are essential, particularly in languages commonly used in data engineering such as Python, Java, or Scala. You should be comfortable with writing efficient and optimized code.<br><br>2. **Database Knowledge**: Data engineers need to have a solid understanding of relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle, as well as non-relational databases like MongoDB or Apache Cassandra. Learn about database design, querying, and optimization techniques.<br><br>3. **Data Warehousing**: Familiarize yourself with data warehousing concepts, including data modeling, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and working with tools like Apache Hive, Apache Spark, or Amazon Redshift.<br><br>4. **Big Data Technologies**: Gain knowledge of distributed systems and big data technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, or Apache Flink. Understand how to process and manage large-scale datasets efficiently.<br><br>5. **Data Integration**: Learn about data integration techniques, including data pipelines, data ingestion, and data integration frameworks like Apache Airflow or Apache NiFi. Understand how to integrate data from various sources and ensure data quality and consistency.<br><br>6. **Cloud Platforms**: Familiarize yourself with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Learn how to leverage cloud services for data storage, processing, and deployment.<br><br>7. **Data Security**: Understand data security and privacy principles, including encryption, access control, and compliance regulations like GDPR or CCPA. Ensure that you handle sensitive data appropriately and securely.<br><br>8. **Data Quality and Testing**: Learn about data quality management and testing methodologies. Understand how to validate and verify data pipelines and ensure the accuracy and reliability of data.<br><br>9. **Data Governance**: Gain an understanding of data governance practices, including metadata management, data cataloging, and data lineage. Know how to create and maintain data dictionaries and data documentation.<br><br>10. **Communication and Collaboration**: Develop strong communication and collaboration skills, as data engineers often work closely with data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders. Effective communication and teamwork are crucial for successful data engineering projects.<br><br>Remember, the specific skills required for data engineering roles may vary depending on the industry, company, and job requirements. It&#39;s always a good idea to research and tailor your learning path to match the specific needs of the roles and organizations you are targeting.<br><br>By focusing on these core skills, you&#39;ll be well-prepared to start a career in data engineering. Good luck!",2023-07-02T20:40:23Z

Later came things like dynamic programming, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, note this fields are 100% computer science and highly probabilistic at the same time. Also computer science students are required to take both classical AI which is discrete and also machine learning which is probabilistic.

I am not an expert in this field, I am just suggesting based on my learning experience. Jumping into ML from knowing nothing is hard. But, if you have the statistics, mathematics and programming (preferably Python) you can easily go into that. See, I don&#39;t have any mathematics background, other than my high school mathematics, but I have always been fascinated about math. Machine Learning heavily relies on math and statistics. You should have a solid understanding on certain concepts and they are easy to learn. You actually can do machine learning without any mathematics knowledge, but it becomes hard for you to understand what happens behind the scenes. <br><br>Don&#39;t worry about the age. I am turning 24 this year, lol. I didn&#39;t have a field before coming into this.I didn&#39;t know what to do. One of my friends asked me to look into this field. Since then, I started to learn on my own. <br><br>Start with learning Python. Since you are from a medical background, I think there are good Python courses for bioinformatics, would be relatable for you. While you are learning python learn the statistics. Take notes in a book (I learn this way better)<br><br>You would definitely feel you are not confident enough or you are not making any progress at one point. Don&#39;t give up. Keep on learning. I&#39;d say, buy some Udemy courses for Python (there are free resources, but for me Udemy is more structured). Udemy occasionally puts their courses for sale, you can get them for around 12-13 dollars per course. Bootcamps for Data Science ( I can&#39;t comment on that, since I have had no interactions with them)<br><br>Doing a Bachelor&#39;s in Medicine is no easy task. If you can do that. Learning ML would be just baby steps for you. Once you are familiar with ML. Get into Deep Learning. Coursera has a Deep Learning for Medical Professionals (as long as I remember). If you have enough projects, you can apply for internships or possibles junior positions. <br><br>Andddd....SQL...Please learn that. I am working as an intern data analyst. My work is mostly around SQL. SQL, I believe would be important for other roles in Data Science. <br><br>You have got this!! All the best!! If you have any more queries, feel free to ask.

Assuming a computer or even a network to be smart, because it contains lots of data and can process computation fast, makes hardly any more sense, than assuming that your book shelf is very wise because of all the literature it is containing.<br><br>AI, as portrayed in science fiction, is a complete fantasy. And it most likely will always remain that way. Because &quot;AI&quot; has no agency of it&#39;s own. Computers of every kind are tools. And as such, they are as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù as the abacus, of which they originated from in principle. Compared to said abacus, computers have only gotten more complex in scale ‚Äì not in principle. They are still mere tools.<br><br>Computation can solve many things - but not all things. Much less all at once. That is why programs, applications and robots are always VERY task specific. Because every task needs tailor made programming to allow applicable computation. And it comes with the territory, that specification also allows for a controlled environment. Because the more specific a task is, the less variables, which computation needs to account for, are possible by default. For the one thing, that AI absolutely sucks at, is unforeseen volatility. It doesn‚Äôt compute and is impossible to plan for.<br><br>That is why programs work the best (by far) in merely virtual spaces. Because as long as something is just happening behind a screen or within the boundaries of a device, that makes for a highly controlled environment. But even in video games, for as fancy as they have become, AI is as dumb as it always has been. If anything, it‚Äôs intrinsic shortcomings have become more obvious, because open world games lay it&#39;s crude nature brutally bare. For open worlds are exactly the virtual representation of highly volatile circumstances. And that is only taking into account the path-finding.",2021-03-12T15:19:49Z

They hear from fear-inducing, outrage-provoking, click-bait garbage headlines from news outlets and it makes them feel excitement. They want to hold onto that feeling, so they will only research things that are in favor of the more outrageous side of something and feed that confirmation bias. That isn&#39;t making yourself smarter, that is a lack of critical thinking skills. Critical thinking involves researching all angles of a particular concept or problem and then drawing your own conclusions in the end. Don&#39;t let garbage news and paranoid minds think for you. There is so much outrage about artificial intelligence and how bad it is, but there is so much GOOD that it can be used for, and I mean AMAZING potential to help people, save lives, and improve the overall quality of life for humanity. To truly understand it, learn about its uses and learn how it works. Don&#39;t just learn conceptually, learn the linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistical mathematics that makes it work. I feel like that will help to better understand the scope of what it can do. It requires human intervention to work: it has to be told exactly what to learn by humans. It doesn&#39;t just go wild and learn what it decides to learn, it just becomes really good at guesses and predictions based on what it was specifically trained on. Sure it can be potentially used for bad things, but so can the internet. Should the internet be taken away? Drinking water is beneficial, but it can also drown people, should water be taken away?

You are made in His image, and that makes you a creation of the most High God, created flawlessly by the One who is Truly good. you are fearfully and wonderfully made and He knew you before you were a thought in your mother&#39;s mind. God calls you by Name today! You are beautful just as you are! Come to Him, for He calls you to Himself today! <br><br>Escape the devil&#39;s iron grip and repent of your sins so that you may be forgiven by Jesus Christ, who died in your place, and accept His free salvation todayüòä<br>For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, all have turned away, none is righteous.  We are not perefect before God, and The reward for sin is separation from an perefect God which leads to Hell. This is due to our willing separation from God&#39;s Holiness by our sin, but the Way back to God&#39;s Love, which He made, was His Only Son, Jesus Christ who loves you enough to give His entire life for you to be saved. If you will believe in His Name, and repent of your sins, and turn fully to Him today. <br><br>You ever think about why Jesus is so mocked?? Do you think someone would mock or hate someone who is real or someone who isn&#39;t? Why do people burn The Bible?? Maybe because it&#39;s words touch people to their very heart.

It is the assumptions that you make that can give a causal interpretation to a regression.<br><br> Correlation is a statistical link between two variables. <br>A bivariate regression is a correlation (with or without the intercept).<br>A multivariate regression is just correlations between variables that can under some conditions and assumptions have a marginal/ceteris paribus/causal interpretation.<br><br>Causality is a different (but linked) topic. As it deals with counterfactual, or &quot;what if ?&quot; questions. The only way to derive causality is to intervene, as stated ‚ÄúNO CAUSATION WITHOUT MANIPULATION&quot;.  We can escape the manipulation step by making assumptions, and using techniques such as finding quasi-experiment or instrumental variables. <br>This can provide a causal interpretation to a regression. The most important thing about causality is to think about the counterfactual (see Mostly Harmless Econometrics chap 1).  <br><br>What is probably true, is that if the specification of your regression has the same structure as the data generating process, then you can have a causal interpretation of your parameters. In practice, it could be ok to have a causal interpretation of your parameters, but bear in mind that it is suggestive evidence, and you can not know if you have an omitted variable bias or a wrong specification of your structural equation model.  <br><br>One more thing, you can rearrange the equation of a regression as you wish, B = kP &lt;=&gt; P = B/k &lt;=&gt; k = B/P.

Because it&#39;s hard to find youtube chanel about R proggraming video tutorials in such a  high quality. In addition, your  video doesn&#39;t take so much time, which is rare in comparison with other videos. However, could you make more videos about functions in R studio, such as &quot;aggregate&quot; &quot;is.element&quot; &quot;cor&quot; or how to make plot; hist; boxplot; pie.

You should estimate necesary minimum number of samples before experiment. And statistical power depends on margin of error too. You choose it which isn&#39;t negligible<br><br>Also accepting a false hypotesis is in fact Type II Error but it is called false positive as You get positive result wrong,2021-09-10T17:19:39Z

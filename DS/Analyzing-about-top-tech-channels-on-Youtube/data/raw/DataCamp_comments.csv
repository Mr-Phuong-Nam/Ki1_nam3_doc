I use Chat GPT all the time, it failed much worse than I am used to. It failed so badly that I ended up having to re-write so much of the article I had copied and pasted from its answer before hitting publish, that I might have been able to write it from scratch in the same amount of time. And saving time was the only reason I tried to have Chat GPT write it for me in the first place.<br><br>But, hey, maybe that was just bad luck, so today, I thought &quot;Wait, I have an idea, why don&#39;t I use the formula and tell it to give me feedback and suggested new content on that article I published yesterday!&quot; Because the version published was quite scant on explanation still, and it failed again, but MUCH WORSE this time. It just started suggesting random paragraphs about any topic imaginable. The first time I burst out laughing. So I git regenerate, same thing. Fast forward to the third time hitting it, and it starting writing about the Green New Deal, and I gave up.",2023-09-05T17:50:47Z

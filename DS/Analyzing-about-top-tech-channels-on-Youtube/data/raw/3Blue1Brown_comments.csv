I have a naive question: we stated that when the polarized light goes through the solution, certain wavelengths get rotated more than others. However, if we were to look at the end of the pole, we would still observe white light, indicating that the superposition is similar to the initial linearly polarized light. Is it expected or intuitive that the superposition of the income light that is in the same plane should be the same as the superposition of the wavelengths that are rotated and are in different planes?

In the graphic the viewer is shown very close to a very large tube,  which makes up maybe 40 degrees of their field of view. This would correspond to a large change in perceived angle by the viewer, and would be a plausible explanation for the strips.<br><br> In the actual video though the tube is very small compared to the field of view of the camera, it maybe makes up a 3 or four degree angle for the field of view. This would correspond to an equally small change in perception of the direction the light is polarized, again maybe 3 or 4 degrees. (Comparing the top of the tube to the bottom in a vertical strip).  Lets compare that to the visual evidence we see in the video.<br><br>We see the light go through nearly a full rotation as it travels through the length of the tube, meaning it changes its angle about 300-400 degrees along the full length of the tube.  (for one wavelength of light, each wavelength having a unique total change in angle as we saw). <br><br>Just from eyeballing it, it looks like the bands of equal intensity light travel about a sixth to a quarter of the tube as they go from the top of the tube to the bottom. From my earlier aprox that would correspond to somewhere around a 50 degree change in perceived polarization angle from the top to the bottom, because our percieved polar angle is shifted this much as we go from the top to the bottom of a vertical slice.  (and 50 is 1/6 of 350). <br><br>This is very wishy washy and just form me eyeballing the footage, and I could just have a critical error in my reasoning but that seems wayy to drastic of a difference, (a  50 degree visual approx to the 2-5 percent angle I think we would see just from perception reasons) Let me know if I am misunderstanding or f you think there might be more to this.<br><br>That said I have a degree in physics and this was a better explanation of light waves than I got my entire college study, love the channel and the vid.",2023-12-15T06:55:25Z

There is one thing I&#39;m still confused about though, if anyone is willing to help me understand. So if I&#39;m understanding correctly, different frequencies of light are slowed down by different amounts because of differences in how they make the particles inside the glass oscillate. One color will make the particles wiggle at it&#39;s specific frequency, and the amplitude will vary based on that frequency. This explanation makes perfect sense to me for a beam of a single color being bent differently from others, but how can this happen simultaneously for all frequencies in white light to achieve the effect of a prism? How can the single layer of particles be oscillating at multiple frequencies at once? Are the waves just added together? and if so wouldn&#39;t the net effect of those oscillations affect all of the frequencies of light? I&#39;m assuming the way the math works out you can just think of the frequencies all acting independently even though they&#39;re in reality added together, but I&#39;m a bit unsure why this would be, and I may just be missing something entirely.",2023-12-16T23:33:37Z

UgwgVl3eqdCvXWce23R4AaABAg,@groovyfan,,1,Cz4Q4QOuoo8,0,0,2023-12-21T22:12:45Z,"1) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) ‚âà x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  You should know, though, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we do next video.",2023-12-21T22:12:45Z

Isn&#39;t that the square root of zero?  (Actually, it&#39;s a great way to start a proof that ends with division by zero - a vertical line, and corresponds to what I call Doyle&#39;s constant that deals with a brief window in time starting with taking the eth root of e and ending with a vertical line.  Delanges sectrices for the unflaking of dark matter, Archimedean spiral for spinning up dark matter, Ceva sectrices for that dark matter breaking into smaller, primordial dark matter and black holes, Dinostratus quadratrix for impacting surrounding black holes, and Maclaurin sectrices for dark matter being slowed down over time.  Split-complex at one, noting the more gravitational nature of diagonal ring/cylinder singularities of baryonic matter from broken dark matter.  Using repetitious bisection (from arbitrary angle trisection), one gets added (SSA) for when dark matter dominates a universe and one gets added for when black holes and rarified singularities make things more gravitational, leading to a Big Crunch.  At 2 = a Big Crunch, the solution to the Basel problem, and the &quot;bellows method&quot; drives things.  A Big Crunch event needs the net gravity from the localized area AND gravitational effects from surrounding universes.  The 2 represents how locked up black holes are making a stacking, planar contact.  Everything else are harmonics - effects on surrounding universes.<br>I see this proof as like trying to climb a steep cliff with the process of dark matter breaking up, getting to the top of the hill (like stable atomic nuclei) and then skiing down the &quot;hill of many black holes&quot; past an inflection point where black hole formation and spaghettification happens, leading to the final vertical line tensor of the Maclaurin trisectrix.  This is much like I have posted about considering the recursive form of Euler&#39;s Identity as being like an old incandescent light bulb that you can see having first, second, and third degree critical points.<br>Ramanujan&#39;s Infinite Sum of negative one-twelfth:  each positional jostling, mass, and gravitational/attractive exchange between universes (defined by Big Bounce events, considering Ramanujan during both Big Crunch and Big Bang sides) ADDS up to evenness (or a partner in marriage - like half of the whole, I guess).<br>Net gravity increases over time from the breaking up of dark matter, much like a vertical asymptote.  It continues to increase, but hits a critical point, much like a vertical tangent, when enough dark matter has weakened and been broken up into the more gravitational baryonic matter (split-complex numbers).  Then, the effects of gravity reach their upper limit - much like a vertical line - at e to the negative e.<br>Over a decade ago, I said that the potential energy of a Big Bang was 1/6 times (the speed of light, cubed).  If I had said Big Bounce instead, I would have been correct, in a sense.",2023-12-19T17:09:26Z

Out the opposite side of the block, greatly attenuated, came an easily recognizable rendition of Mozart 40... about one-half nanosecond sooner than it &quot;should&quot; have been able to. <br><br>In other words, some tiny fraction of the microwave photons had TUNNELLED through the solid metal, <b>faster than light.</b> In that example, Nimtz claimed &quot;only&quot; <b>four point seven times c,</b> because of his experimental limits on precision, but other experimenters have greatly exceed that rate. Within experimental limits, tunneling takes approximately ZERO TIME. Those experiments do not prove &quot;time travel&quot; but they do demonstrate FTL communication.

Convolution is heavily used in digital audio processing as a way of simulating reverb of specific spaces in a very precise manner based on a recorded (or simulated) &quot;impulse response&quot; from the space, defining how the space responds to different audio frequencies. Ideally, the impulse that the space is responding to can be defined as a perfectly short burst of white noise, but realistically if you can&#39;t do a sine wave sweep covering all audible frequencies, you&#39;re going to use something like a gunshot (starter pistol), balloon pop, or clap. But really you want to be able to play an audio file you can then use to <b>deconvolve</b> your field recording to get an impulse response. In any case, a normal distribution for audio would be a sample or generator of white noise (not <b>technically</b> but close enough and I bet your Central Limit Theorem video which I haven&#39;t watched yet explains why). Other kinds of noise could have other distributions but either way, if you progressively, iteratively re-convolve any audio sample with white noise or a source of normally distributed noise, it will get closer and closer to that noise distribution. This can be done in any audio editor or DAW with convolution reverb.",2023-08-22T07:02:22Z

Convolving the resulting image with the inverse of the rect function will remove the distortions caused by the aperture. <br>One strategy on smaller telescopes (especially using film instead of digital sensors) to avoid this is to put a filter on the aperture whose opacity follows a Gaussian, clearest in the center and darkest at the edge.

What&#39;s presented is, in essence, the DP-3T algorithm, but needless to say it&#39;s a much-simplified version, so most security-related questions can be answered by going to <a href=""https://github.com/DP-3T"">https://github.com/DP-3T</a> and reading the full details.  For example, if you&#39;re thinking that when Bob&#39;s phone recognizes some signals in the hospital&#39;s database, it can deduce <i>when</i> Bob met with the someone now known to be sick by looking at where that message shows up on its &quot;What I heard&quot; list, you may be interested to learn how the full details of how these ids are generated and uploaded don&#39;t quite make that as possible as it would be for the simplified version outlined in Nicky&#39;s post.<br><br>One of the biggest concerns is over the efficacy of Bluetooth systems like this.  For example, false positives due to signals shared through apartment walls, and false negatives due to touching a shared surface without ever being near someone.  No one claims that these will catch all contacts, but the goal is to have a system more scalable than in-person interviews, and what you need is for R to stay consistently below 1, not to catch all cases.  Any serious plans for reopening including a system like this also would include other practices driving this reproductive number down, like mask-wearing and distancing where possible.  Also, to the accuracy concerns, it seems worth mentioning that at least one person I know is working on <a href=""https://www.novid.org/"">https://www.novid.org/</a> which incorporates ultrasound to get a better sense of proximity.<br><br>Many government-issued contact-tracing apps <b>do</b> use GPS in some way, so you&#39;d want to stay informed about whatever specific system is being advertised to you.  The purpose of Nicky&#39;s post is to make clear that contact tracing does not <i>imply</i> location tracking.  If people (or governments) really want to use GPS based contact tracing too, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t have both.  But if you&#39;re in a country where people can choose to opt-in, you won&#39;t be including people who are concerned about privacy. <br><br>As to the status of the Google/Apple system, the first phase of their plan involved putting out an API that developers can use to build apps according to these standards, which is now done.  The second phase will involve doing something built into the phone&#39;s OS, which people can opt in to.  For my part, I think the most plausible scenario where we have mass adoption comes something in the OS like this.",2020-05-18T01:12:20Z

However you&#39;ve made <i>several</i> critical errors in your assessment here. As a security researcher, I&#39;d be happy to talk to you more about this, but a brief summary can be found below;<br><br>First of all, the concern people have isn&#39;t generally that other people with the app (Bob) can infer their GPS location. That&#39;s what your video describes the protection through obfuscation against. The concern is around that central tabulary, and it takes literally one string of data (the device ID) being leaked through the application, which could happen in a later update and doesn&#39;t have to be currently present in the code, to make Alice and her network of contacts trackable (definitely and trivially by &#39;Big Brother&#39; but also by <i>any</i> bad actor). More concerning is that, from a &#39;Big Brother&#39; standpoint, there are innumerable ways of making that happen without even needing to modify the app itself. <br><br>Again, I&#39;d be happy to go into detail with you on this, but what I want you to understand is that these apps as designed <b>in no way</b> protect privacy, and do constitute a substantial overreach. The timing corresponding to an extension of the warrantless surveillance act is also of concern for privacy advocates.<br><br>Please feel free to reach out to me, I&#39;d welcome the opportunity to repay the gift of knowledge by teaching you something for once.",2020-05-14T15:34:17Z

There is an extremely small but still sort-of existent chance that the number being sent out by your phone is a duplicate of someone else&#39;s, assuming that this operates offline. The side effect of this is that people would be forced to isolate when they don&#39;t necessarily have COVID-19 (although the likelihood is very, very low, and dependent on the key size). If it operates online with a method of preventing collisions, then it is possible to compromise your privacy because things connected to the internet can be traced, and thus the consumer would have to trust the dev&#39;s implementation of the DP-3T algorithm in some sort of tracing app. Nothing is perfect I guess, but this is pretty close.",2021-05-01T21:43:03Z

I don&#39;t care for your lockdown math at all. Before I even watch this video I&#39;m going to show you the REAL lockdown math. Firstly, from 1940 to 1950, possibly due to the war ending, there was a 43% increase (in the UK) in the number of births per year by the end of the decade. It&#39;s now 2021 and we&#39;re already starting to see the  knock-on effect from that. There was an 8% increase in deaths in 2020 compared to the 5 year average based on data ONLY going as far back as 2015. What&#39;s also interesting to note is the fact that these excess deaths were all attributed to covid19 and the median age of the people who died of covid19 was 80. These were generally, people who were war babies reaching the predicted age of life expectancy which, on average, is 80. If you ACTUALLY do the math you can calculate that the number of deaths per year from 2020 to 2030 is going to increase by 43%, and that the median age of the excess deaths will be 80. Secondly, given the INEVITABILITY of the forecasted &quot;global pandemic&quot; of the war-babies reaching the age of life-expectancy now, the liar politicians and their fake news associates have an opportunity to invest in the big businesses set to inherit all the turf from all the small businesses that they can illegally force to shut down under the pretence of a harmless little &quot;coronavirus&quot; literally as harmless as the common cold or flu, which they can easily track with PCR testing (business opportunity there) and blame (by association) all the &quot;excess deaths&quot; on, and use to scare people into taking a &quot;vaccine&quot; against which is the global market for soul-erasing genetic-modification technology worth trillions of [insert name of global currency here], ESCPECIALLY if they FORCE people to have it. Thirdly, now that you see how easy it is to predict the crimes of the scum who are behind this scam and above the law, it&#39;s MUCH easier to predict REALITY. Here&#39;s the reality: It&#39;s a virus so harmless that the only way to know if you&#39;ve got it is by taking a test. It&#39;s a virus so harmless that the only people who died from it were the people who reached the average age of life expectancy, so it&#39;s impossible to know if the &quot;coronavirus&quot; is what killed them or whether they are just the &quot;excess deaths&quot; expected from the war-baby boom 80 years ago?",2021-02-22T13:38:07Z

We know that the Pythagorean Theorem is:  A^2+ B^2 = C^2. Let&#39;s keep this in mind.<br><br>I will show and prove 4 - 5 different things that most math classes never fully express and these are the following:<br>    *  The Pythagorean Theorem and the Equation to a Circle are symbolically similar, also The equation to the Unit Circle centered at the origin is, in fact, the Pythagorean Theorem! It&#39;s just that one is in terms of right triangles and the other is in terms of a circle with a radius of 1.<br>    *  That there is a direct relationship of the Trigonomic Functions and linear equations in regards to their slopes.<br>    *  Without considering the use of limits and applying them, the Tangent Function is, in contrast, the definition of the slope function that is used to define a derivative within Calculus.<br>    * That vector notation is symbolic of both linear and trigonometric calculations. For example ‚ü®a,b‚ü©=‚à•a‚à•‚à•b‚à•cosŒ∏ which states that the dot product between two vectors is the product of their magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. So if you know the lengths of two vectors you can find the angle! After you calculate the dot product, then you would have to take the arccos of that value, however, make sure you are using the right system (degrees, radians) to get the correct result you are looking for.<br>   * All of this is rooted in the simplest of all mathematical expressions, not even an equation or a function, just a simple expression, being the very first one we are ever taught: (1+1) and that the operation of adding one to itself satisfies the construction of both the Unit Circle and defines the Pythagorean Theorem. Also, when we turn this into an equation (1+1) = 2 we will see that there is perfect symmetry, reflection, and rotation that is embedded within this. <br><br> The comparison of the Pythagorean Theorem and the Equation to a Circle:<br>    The equation to an arbitrary circle is defined by (x ‚Äì h)^2 + (y ‚Äì k)^2 = r^2 where (h,k) is the 2D coordinate of the center of the circle. <br>    Let&#39;s center this at the origin (0,0) and refer to the unit circle with a radius of 1. We now end up with:  (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 1^2 =  x^2 + y^2 = 1.<br>    Let&#39;s compare this to the Pythagorean Theorem. x^2 + y^2 = 1 == A^2 + B^2 + C^2 when C = 1. So for any circle that is centered at the origin, it&#39;s equation is the Pythagorean Theorem.<br><br>The direct relationship of the Trigonometric Functions and Linear Equations:<br>  We will use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: y = mx+b.  We know that m is defined by rise/run or (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) where can use the coordinate points to find the slope. The value of this slope is a proportion of how much change in height over the change in the horizontal. All angles will be relative to the line y = mx+b and the x-axis.  In other words, it is the angle that is above the X-axis or the Horizontal axis up to the line itself. Here I mentioned the rate of change. We can take rise/run or (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) and rewrite this as dy/dx. We know that we can make a right triangle from the x-axis up to the line in question. By doing so we can see that the dy is also sin(t) and dx is cos(t). We can see that the slope of the line m is also the tangent of the angle above the horizon to that line. So we can rewrite the slope-intercept form y = mx+b to y = tan(t)x + b or sin(t)/cos(t)x + b. This will lead us to the next section about derivatives!<br><br>The Tangent Function and the Derivative: We know that when we have a curve that its slope is not constant. We can take two points on that curve that are relatively close and get a good approximation of its slope near that point, however, the farther the gap the more margin of error this is. This approach is what is referred to as finding the secant slope. If we make smaller and smaller incremental steps where we get closer and closer to that point where the limit of the size of that step approaches 0, we then end up with a line that has the slope of that point which is tangent to that curve at that point. This is seen in the difference quotient in Calculus to find a derivative.  f&#39;(x) = lim dx-&gt;0  (f(x+dx) - f(x))/dx  Which is basically taking the slope form of a line (y2 - y1/(x2-x1) and rewriting it from point notation into function notation with respect to x, changing the difference in points to rate of change by using delta x and delta y, which is still all algebra, and the only part that is Calculus is when you actually apply the limit! So in a sense, we can see a direct relationship and similarity of (f(x+dx) - f(x)) / dx  and tan(t). If we substitute tan(t) as sin(t)/cos(t). We can see that cos(t) = dx which is straight forward. However, if we look at f(x+dx) - f(x) it isn&#39;t quite obvious but this would be equivalent to sin(t). Where t is the angle above the x-axis and up to the point on the curve whose slope is the tangent of that angle produced by that linear equation.<br><br>The vector portion should be self-explanatory as I had already mentioned the most important piece and that is the dot product in relation to the cosine of the angle between those two vectors. Not much more needs to be expressed about this here, but will be referred in the last section. <br><br>(...continued in a reply to this post)",2023-10-19T09:36:14Z

Consider the value 1 to be an arbitrary unit length, it could be 1 inch, 1 mile, 1 cm, it doesn&#39;t matter! Now, take a piece of square paper and mark a point near the center of the paper, then draw a line from there in any direction and stop a little less than 1/2 across the paper and make another point where you stopped. Now go back to the center and mark this as 0. Then mark the endpoint as 1 and make a slight arrowhead at that point. Direction here is completely arbitrary and agnostic to the length or magnitude of that line segment or vector that you had just drawn. Now this will be a unit vector. The starting point labeled 0 will be the 0 vector, this will be important later on. Now rotate this paper until the line segment is parallel with your body and that the 1 is to the right side. What we are going to do next is to apply the operation of addition to this unit vector with itself. By convention addition in the positive sense will be towards the right. So what you now need to do is visualize that entire line from 0 to 1 sliding across itself so that the 0 point is now at 1 and the new endpoint of 1 is near the edge of the paper you can mark this with a 2 and put another arrowhead there. By drawing these two vectors you have physically done (1+1) = 2. Okay, so we saw this being done through vectors. I had you do this to express the importance that Addition is a Linear Transformation. It is Translation to be exact. Now without knowing it, by performing that addition you also simultaneously performed multiplication. You see Addition is a 1 Dimensional Operation, but it introduces us into 2 Dimensional Space. It doesn&#39;t seem apparent yet, but I will get to that! We know that (1+1) = 2 and we know that 1*2 = 2. So we can easily see that (1+1) = 1*2 = 2*1. <br><br>Multiplication is embedded within addition, however, multiplication can be both a 1 and 2 Dimensional Transformations. A 1D Transformation of multiplication is scaling or shearing in a specific direction and a 2D transformation is a Rotation or defining Area. Now, how does this relate to the Unit Circle, Triangles, Trigonometry, The Pythagorean Theorem, and even Calculus? It&#39;s quite simple... let&#39;s take a step back and remember when I said to draw a line in any arbitrary direction... then I had you rotate that paper to position the line to be parallel with your body and the line pointing to the right. Now, we denoted this as being +1 which could be symbolic with the direction East. Nothing stopped us from being able to go West by 1 unit. So now let&#39;s make another unit vector that goes from the origin 0, and mark this Western or Left point with a 1. Now, when it comes to vectors, the magnitudes of the first vector, and this new one are the same, but their directions are Opposite. So we can use the negative sign to represent the opposite direction. So we can now add a - to this 1. If we add these two values (1) + (-1) we end up with 0 which leads us back to the starting point or the 0 vector. However, their combined value |1| + |-1| = 2. These three values of 0, 1 and 2 are all related to each other. Now we said that addition is a 1D transformation translation to be exact. We also said that 1+1 =2 is also multiplication. Well we have a line and there is no area, so the 2D transformation here must be rotation. Let&#39;s take the first line 0 to 1 and rotate that about the 0 point and see what happens when we end up at -1. We did a 1/2 rotation of a full circle. <br><br>We know that the arc length is PI and that the central angle is 180 degrees. We also know that a line has 180 degrees of rotation which is also the addition of all 3 interior angles of any triangle. We know that the unit circle has a radius of 1 and a diameter of 2. Its circumference is 2PI and its area is PI unit^2. Yes, even the value PI is embedded in the expression (1+1).  This expression has a perfect symmetry and complete rotation embedded within it. It also has perfect reflection too. And if we understand what Derivatives and Integrals are, we also know that (1+1) doesn&#39;t just introduce multiplication but it also introduces powers because (1+1) = 2^1  which is a 3D transformation provided there are three components to the vector. For each component of a vector &lt;x&gt;, &lt;x,y&gt;, &lt;x,y,z&gt;, etc... the number of elements or the size of that vector is the dimensional space we are working in. Each dimensional space has specific attributes or properties. 0D = an arbitrary point. 1D = length, magnitude, line.  2D = rotation, area. 3D = multiple rotations and volume. etc... We also know that when we look at the polynomials in algebra: f(x) = x, f(x) = x^2, f(x) = x^3 that x is just x which is a scalar quantity and is linear and that x^2 represents the area of all squares, and that x^3 represents the volume of all cubes provided x is +, there is a case where x can be - in to define a - volume, but this involves complex numbers and is completely abstract! We also know that x, x^2, and x^3 are partially derivatives and integrals to each other so to speak.  F(x) = xdx = 1/2x^2 + c.  which states that the integral of f(x) = x is the family of functions f(x) 1/2x^2 + c. and so on, and the reverse is true too. All of this is embedded in (1+1) = 2. All of your irrational numbers are embedded within it. Your logarithmic and exponential functions are embedded within it! Everything is integrated or derived from (1+1)!&quot;",2023-10-19T09:36:27Z

The concepts of a real number and a non-real (imaginary) number are in logical relation of contradiction: the essential feature of one concept completely negates the essential feature of another concept. These concepts have no common feature (i.e. these concepts have nothing in common with each other), therefore one cannot compare these concepts with each other. Consequently, the concepts of a real number and a non-real (imaginary) number cannot be united and contained in the definition of a complex number. The concept of a complex number is a gross formal-logical error; (2) the real part of a complex number is the result of a measurement. But the non-real (imaginary) part of a complex number is not the result of a measurement. The non-real (imaginary) part is a meaningless symbol, because the mathematical (quantitative) operation of multiplication of a real number by a meaningless symbol is a meaningless operation. This means that the theory of complex number is not a correct method of calculation. Consequently, mathematical (quantitative) operations on meaningless symbols are a gross formal-logical error; (3) a complex number cannot be represented (interpreted) in the Cartesian geometric coordinate system, because the Cartesian coordinate system is a system of two identical scales (rulers). The standard geometric representation (interpretation) of a complex number leads to the logical contradictions if the scales (rulers) are not identical. This means that the scale of non-real (imaginary) numbers cannot exist in the Cartesian geometric coordinate system. Consequently, the theory of complex numbers and the use of the theory of complex numbers in mathematics and physics (electromagnetism and electrical engineering, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity) represent a gross methodological error and lead to gross errors in mathematics and physics.",2023-12-20T03:21:50Z

As a philosopher I especially love the question about &quot;really exist&quot;, because in philosophy to be real and to exist and are theory dependent. In the philosophy, a specific version of Aristotelian categories, existence is a subset of reality. According this, none number exists, as words do not exist, and in the case of &quot;happiness&quot;, not even the concept of &quot;happiness&quot; exists. (Only the phenomenon usually described as happiness does). Numbers are abstract entities and as such, do not exist but are real, including imaginary numbers. Only the irreal is not, and as far as I know, there are no &quot;irreal&quot; numbers.<br>Anyways, this classification is completly inefficiant for maths.

I even said, &quot;oh, you could just scale it&quot;.  This thought of scaling is not correct, since (c*f(a))(c*f(b)) = c^2 f(a + b), so the lhs and rhs doesn&#39;t scale the same way.<br>- At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxYOEwM6Wbk&amp;t=27m48s"">27:48</a>, Sam points out that the constant function f(x) = 0 doesn&#39;t work, which I misread as asking about whether f(x) = 0 for some x (sorry Sam!).<br>- Crispin points out that f(0) must be 1 because f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x)*f(0).  This is true, as long as f(x) does not equal 0 everywhere, but at that point, I was still weirdly blind to that edge case and enthusiastically accepted this as a reason that the question was originally graded correctly.<br>- At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxYOEwM6Wbk&amp;t=49m07s"">49:07</a>, more of the discussion that has been happening on twitter is brought to screen, where Eric correctly points out that Crispin&#39;s proof doesn&#39;t work for the constant function f(x) = 0, which  Sam had said all along much earlier and I misread.<br><br><br>Thanks for the good discussion, and the tolerance of some live befuddlement.",2020-04-29T16:04:12Z

Napier calculated log1,log2,log3,....log 10000000....( Log in this context means log basis 10).He noticed that: log(x *y)= logx+ log y means that x*y becomes easy if we could compute logx+ logy...

Another way to say it is the derivative at any position, is the same as that position rotated by 90 degrees. And since the line tangent to a certain point on a circle is a line perpendicular to the line from the center of the circle to that certain point, that original function traces out a circle.<br><br>We can also think of a function A^(ix) where A is a real number. This will also trace out a circle.<br>Let&#39;s try taking the derivative of this function. But first, I&#39;ll change the way the function is written to make taking the derivative of it easier<br>A^(ix) = e^(ln(A)ix)<br>The derivative of that is:<br>ln(A)ie^(ln(A)ix) = ln(A)iA^(ix)<br>Notice that this derivative is basically ln(A)i TIMES the original function. We know that ln(A) is a real number, so what we&#39;re doing in the derivative is the original function rotated 90 degrees (because it is multiplied by i), and then multiplied by ln(A).<br>The point is that the derivative is still the original function rotated 90 degrees BUT THEN it&#39;s also multiplied by some real number factor.<br>This simply makes the rotation process be faster by ln(A). So instead of having to evaluate the original function at 2pi to make a full revolution, you only need to evaluate it at 2pi/ln(A) to make a full revolution<br><br>Now, let&#39;s think about what happens if the derivative is the original function that is rotated by some amount that is NOT 90 degrees. What does that make??<br>This may be a part that needs more explanation for this whole intuitive-explanation to be more satisfactory, but if you think about it a bit...<br>Let&#39;s say that the derivative is the original function rotated by some amount MORE than 90 degrees.<br>So instead of tracing out a perfect circle... The &quot;trace-line&quot; will instead... SPIRAL OUTWARDS!<br>If the derivative is the original function rotated by some amount LESS than 90 degrees, then the function will result in an INWARD SPIRAL!<br>The meaning of inward and outward spiral is just where the spiral goes as x INCREASES right. idk if i needed to point that out but might as well. if it spiral inwards then it approaches 0 as x goes to infinity, but if it spiral outwards, then it approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, but approaches 0 as x goes to negative infinity.<br><br>So now let&#39;s go back to the math stuff.<br>Previously, we were thinking about a function in the form of A^(ix) where A is a real number and the derivative of this is that same function rotated 90 degrees which will trace out a circle.<br>Now let&#39;s think of a function in the form of (ai)^(ix) where `a` is a real number<br>Let&#39;s try taking the derivative of this function. Before that, let&#39;s review that ln(i) = pi/2i<br>So first, we kind of rewrite the function in a way that makes it easy for us to take the derivative of the function<br>(ai)^(ix) = e^(ln(ai)ix)<br>Now take the derivative<br>d/dx [e^(ln(ai)ix] = ln(ai)ie^(ln(ai)ix) = ln(ai)i(ai)^(ix)<br>Which, if we think of the original function (ai)^(ix) to be equal to f(x), can be rewritten as:<br>ln(ai)if(x)<br>Which is basically the original function TIMES ln(ai)i<br>Now this ln(ai)i actually decides how much the original function is rotated at any point. We know that if this factor is simply `i` then it&#39;s a rotation of 90 degrees. Now let&#39;s find out if ln(ai)i results in a rotation of 90 degrees. If it DOESN&#39;T, then from what we&#39;ve talked about before, we know that it makes a SPIRAL!<br><br>Before we continue, I wanna talk a tiny bit more again about complex number multiplication<br>So we have f(x) and f(x) is supposed to return a COMPLEX NUMBER, right.<br>Any complex number multiplied by an imaginary number `ai` will result in that complex number being rotated by 90 degrees and then the magnitude will be multiplied by a<br>But what if we multiply a complex number by... another complex number?<br>Say we have some VARIABLE complex number Z and we have some constant complex number (a + bi)<br>How much does the variable complex number Z, for any value of Z, get rotated by if we multiply it by the constant complex number (a + bi)<br>Well, we can try to remember the geometric interpretation of complex number multiplications.<br>The resulting complex number from a multiplication of 2 complex numbers z1 and z2 will have a rotation of the sum of those 2 complex numbers&#39; rotation and a magnitude of the product of those 2 complex numbers&#39; magnitude<br>First, let&#39;s try finding the individual rotation of the two complex numbers and store them in the variables t1 and t2<br>t1 = atan(Im(z1)/Re(z1))<br>t2 = atan(Im(z2)/Re(z2))<br>Meaning that the sum of the rotations of the two complex numbers is:<br>t = t1 + t2<br>t = atan(Im(z1)/Re(z1)) + atan(Im(z2)/Re(z2))<br>Now let&#39;s store the sum of the magnitude in a variable called m<br>m = |z1| * |z2|<br>The resulting complex number in terms of the product of the magnitude and the sum of the rotations will be:<br>z1z2 = m * (cos(t) + isin(t))<br>You can try expanding m and t in there to get the full formula, but I just want the big picture here, I guess.<br>From that formula, we know that the rotation of the product of the two complex numbers will be the sum of the rotation of the two complex numbers.<br>Meaning that if you multiply a complex number z1 by another complex number z2, the result will ROTATE z1 by the rotation of z2<br>If we think of z1 as the variable complex number Z and z2 as some constant complex number (a + bi), then we know that, for any value of Z, multiplying it with the constant complex number (a + bi) will rotate the complex number Z by the rotation of a + bi which is equal to atan(b/a)<br><br>So let&#39;s go back to the derivative of (ai)^(ix) which is ln(ai)i(ai)^(ix)<br>Let&#39;s rewrite this so that it looks more like a complex number<br>And let&#39;s actually set f(x) to be equal to the original function (ai)^(ix)<br>f(x) = (ai)^(ix)<br>f&#39;(x) = ln(ai)if(x) = (ln(a) + ln(i))if(x)<br>Expand ln(i) = pi/2i and put the outer i in<br>f&#39;(x) = (ln(a)i - pi/2)f(x)<br>And from there, we know that the derivative of f(x) IS EQUAL TO f(x) (which is a complex number Z if we compare it to the example in the discussion about complex numbers earlier) ROTATED BY the rotation of the complex number &quot;ln(a)i - pi/2&quot; (which is the constant complex number a + bi in the previous example) which is NOT a 90 degree rotation so this is able to make a spiral. Or, well, if the rotation is 180 degrees, notice that it will just.. make a line. In this case, the function will have the form of i^i<br>To be more specific, f&#39;(x) is going to be f(x) rotated by atan(-ln(a)/(pi/2)) = atan(-2ln(a)/pi)<br><br>So, in conclusion, (ai)^(ix) can trace out a spiral or a line or even nothing if a = 0<br>At values between 0 and 1, the derivative of the function is the function rotated by some positive value less than 90 degrees, and at values above 1, it gets rotated by some negative value more than -90 degrees.<br>What that means is, if you go slowly from a = 1 to a = 0, the shape will go from a line, and then a spiral that starts by going up and &quot;expands&quot; really quickly, and then into a spiral that expands more slowly, and in the end the shape will approach a circle.<br>At values above 1, if you go from a = 1 to a = infinity, the shape will go from a line, and then a spiral that starts by going down and expands really quickly, and then the a spiral that expands more slowly, and in the end the shape will approach a circle.<br><br>Notice how the rotation of the derivative doesn&#39;t ever go above 90 degrees. Meaning the spiral should always spiral INWARDS.<br><br>you can extend this explanation again to a function in the form of (a + bi)^(ix) but im too lazy right now, haven&#39;t thought about that as much<br>also havent thought about the fact that negative `a` values doesn&#39;t work cuz ln &lt;= 0 is undefined..<br>i think the rotation becomes atan(-ln(a)/(2pi)) or something<br>cuz we had ln(ai)if(x), in this case it becomes ln(-ai)if(x) = (ln(-i) + ln(a))if(x)<br>just think about the rotation:<br>(ln(-i) + ln(a))i = (i2pi + ln(a))i = iln(a) - 2pi<br>and the rotation of that complex number is atan(-ln(a)/(2pi))<br>so yeah thats that.<br><br>i dont think that was a very good explanation and idk if thats really a good way of viewing this but well i just wanted to write what i thought about so yeah",2023-08-31T18:24:57Z

It&#39;s not an equation with a problem on one side and a solution on the other.  Yo solve problems correctly you need to be able to see and understand the relationships between all the interacting parts of the environment that the problem exists in, you then alter the environment so that the problem disappears.  Solutions always make the problem disappear.  This is also different from solving a puzzle which is also not a problem.  Please do not describe puzzles as problems because they are not.  It&#39;s very important that you understand that solving a &quot;puzzle&quot; is not solving a &quot;problem&quot;, and finding an &quot;answer&quot; to a mathematical &quot;equation&quot; is also not solving a &quot;problem&quot;.

Now if we have 0.6 instead, then it would be 60; 0.9 would be 90, and 0.96 would de 960 in a thousand or 48 in 50.

It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  You should know, though, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.

Really it should be ceil(pi/theta) - 1, to account for the cases where pi/theta is an integer.  For example, when the mass ratio is 1, theta will be pi/4, so pi/theta is 4, but there are 3 clacks.  As stated in the video, though, you still think about this is &quot;how many times can you add theta to itself before it surpasses (or equals) pi?&quot;<br><br><br>2) What I animate here as I say &quot;angle of reflection&quot; and &quot;angle of incidence&quot; differs a little with convention.  Typically in optics, you look at the angle between the beam and a line <b>perpendicular</b> to the mirror, rather than with the mirror itself.<br><br>3) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) ‚âà x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>4) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  This is common in the context of math, but you should know, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we did here.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed this little sequence.  I still get happy whenever I think about the phenomenon and the various explanations for it.",2019-04-22T22:03:38Z

The uber-geniuses of any given age aren&#39;t much impacted by debates like the pi/tau debate, because these debates concern themselves with the difference between two representations that are computationally easy to go between. Thus in the IQ range of 150+, such distinctions make essentially no difference. Now if your IQ is 140 or below, on the other hand, suddenly every CPU cycle has to be treated as really quite precious, and any time spent laboriously transforming between these two viewpoints is time spent not doing productive thinking. So, that&#39;s the secret: the reason the pi/tau debate matters is because these concepts are taught to millions of people with IQ&#39;s in the 70-140 range, and in this range the difference really, really matters. Incidentally, I personally believe that quad = tau/4 = pi/2 = 90 degrees is the correct (read: easiest) constant. So my ranking is this: quad is easiest to understand, tau is second easiest to understand, and pi is the hardest and most confusing of the three.",2023-12-05T06:56:07Z

So, while what you&#39;re saying is true, it doesn&#39;t need to be the opposite to include the center apparently.<br>I guess you meant to say &quot;1 and only 1 of these 4 outcomes, leaves P3 within the angle opposite of P1 and P2, which includes the center.&quot; Leaving out the details is quite important for people like me who look at these kinds of lessons from a teacher, and then, back in highschool, would conclude: &quot;Either I&#39;m stupid, or I&#39;m surrounded by idiots, but in either case, I have no hopes for my next exam.&quot; Whenever I try to ask for more clarity, I could never find the right words which just left the teacher confused because from their perspective I seem to be struggling to accept the fact that 1 + 1 = 2, but from my perspective what they&#39;re saying is &quot;1 + one = 2&quot; which is clearly not the same.",2023-11-17T20:06:37Z

And so is the width. So the area is a simple multiplication.<br><br>But in the case of a sphere, that length is a diameter of a circle, which has expanded left and right (one dimension), as well as forward and backwards (another dimension) in all possible ways you can turn.<br><br>Like a wave that forms when a stone is dropped in a pond of calm water. That circle has stretched out by its diameter. <br>And that diameter is our length. <br><br>If a circle has stretched out left and right, forward and backwards, that means the only other dimension left is up and down. <br>Meaning the circle can be flipped or rotate up and down.<br><br>So here&#39;s the question with area of a sphere.<br>How many times did a diameter of a circle which goes left and right, forward and backward, repeat itself in going up and down.<br><br>To visualize this...<br>Picture one circle, let&#39;s call it Circle A, with a diameter that goes left and right, forward and backwards. <br>Imagine that circle A is fitted inside another circle, let&#39;s call it Circle B with a diameter that goes up and down. <br><br>Now keep on drawing more circles like Circle A, as if to get a picture by picture rendition of rotating circle A around circle B provided they all fit in circle B, and it won&#39;t be long before you notice that you&#39;re tracing out the circumference of Circle B. <br><br>Equally so, you&#39;ll notice that there will be two ends of circle A, that will not rotate and will stay fixed. These two connected, form your diameter, such that if you&#39;re rotating circle A in circle B, there will be two points in circle A, that will not touch circle B and will stay fixed throughout the rotation. <br>The distance between these two points is what we are measuring the repetition of. <br><br>And so a very logical definition based meaning is that how many times did we repeat that diameter in going up and down. <br><br>Diameter is 2r. And the circumference is 2œÄr...<br>Multiply these two and you get your surface area. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if any of this made sense, but I&#39;m putting it out here to whoever will understand or care.<br><br>Aight!",2023-12-19T20:23:00Z

In other words, the equal distribution should be a property of the modulo operation itself in any unchanging, regular counting system with any unchanging base.

My solution, preceded by its process, goes as follows:<br><br>&quot;To connect all points to each other, each point is connected to all unconnected point in clockwise sequence. The point being connected to other points is the active point, p_a; the final point in sequence is p_f. The number of sections created (in other words, added to, and not including, the total number of sections prior to connection) between p_a and some target point p_t is equal to the number of connections made between points p_(n&lt;a) and points p_(a&lt;n&lt;t) (where n is some whole number), plus one for the &quot;base&quot; connection between p_a and p_t. Such a number of connections may be represented by [p_(n&lt;a) * p_(a&lt;n&lt;t) + 1].&quot;<br><br>After jotting down the notes above subsequent to a couple rough drafts on the problem that were either incomplete or just wrong, I arrived via some trial, error, and intuition at the function below:<br><br>&quot;s(f) = 1 + Sum(Lower: i=1 ; Upper: f-1){Sum(Lower: n=i+1; Upper: f){(i-1)(n-1-i)+1}}&quot; (I realize this is a mess without the special Desmos notation, I can provide a picture of my notebook if needed)<br><br>I think this demonstrates that math is more open-ended than how it&#39;s taught in K-12, and that math seems to &quot;overlap&quot; on itself from time-to-time.

There are also hints of topology here, since we&#39;re finding a way to treat binomial multiplication as informationally equivalent to counting subset sums.<br><br>Maybe the rest of the video will already say all this. üòÖ I guess I&#39;ll find out soon enough.",2023-11-21T07:50:56Z

The transformation must then only affect the other dimension of the plane hence why the slice of a cylinder is always a cone. Tried to generalize to points that are not infinitely far away but not sure how to do it. I think it has something to do with how the direction of the plane that is preserved under projection from a point at infinity now changes a little because of the slant of the cone.,2023-11-24T21:38:03Z

Therefore if you cut the cone in anyway other than perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the point then one side of your circle will be longer than the other because of the fact that the cone is not a static diameter along its hight.,2023-10-30T23:01:14Z

Make the jewels into colored segments, then connect the ends of the string together to make a circle. Then pick a color and find the centroid of all the segments of that color (the circle excluding the segments of the other color). This gives you a point where all of the lines that go through it split the color 50%. Then make a line that goes through the center of the circle and the centroid of one of the colors. This splits the circle 50% and also the proportions of the gems are equal on both sides, so you can mark where the line cuts the circle and undo the string connection. This gives 2 cuts at most for the 2-jewel problem. Maybe this can be generalized.",2023-05-12T22:49:46Z

I tap out the abbreviated version in case it is of interest. Problem: kid carrying a 5-foot metal post wants to board a bus. Bus driver says &#39;no carry on items over 3 feet in any dimension allowed&#39;. What is the kid to do? Solution: Of course the kid ducks into a (say FedX) shipping store and purchases a 3 x 3 x 3 foot box. Now the kid is depending on the bus driver to use the implicit box-based coordinate system. Extension: Suppose FedX has started selling 4D boxes. Or 20-dimensional boxes. Is it true that the kid can purchase a very &quot;small&quot; box -- say 4 inches on a side for each of 20 dimensions where this box will accommodate the five foot post?,2023-08-03T18:16:03Z

Ultimately, we will take a nested sequence of convex hulls. Each time we find a new hull H, we will remove the points of S that live on the boundary of H (which are exactly the vertices of H), then take the convex hull of the remaining points. Eventually, we will be left with a set of 0-2 points that cannot form any further hulls (call this set Z), and we will be left with a single, smallest convex hull, call it H*<br><br>Select P to be any vertex of H* (which must be in S), and L to be any line that goes through the inside of H* (for sake of simplicity, we can choose L such that it does not intersect any other points of S, since S is finite). After that, our ‚Äúwindmill‚Äù process will force L to stay inside of H* forever, in the sense that the intersection of L with H* will always be a nontrivial line segment (i.e., not a single point). Furthermore, L will hit every point of S infinitely many times (including the points of Z), all while remaining ‚Äúlocated‚Äù inside of H*‚Ä¶ Proof to follow<br><br><br>First, consider the scenario where the points of S happen to form a single convex polygon, call it H for Hull. Then we can simply take P to be any point of S, and L can essentially be any line (though for simplicity, suppose we avoid lines that hit any of the other vertices). If this line L is completely outside H (in the sense that it only intersects H at P), then the windmill process will simply take L on a cyclic tour around the outside of H, eventually arriving back at our starting pivot P. (Feel free to consider small examples of 2-4 points for a moment to see this)<br><br>On the other hand, if L begins ‚Äúinside‚Äù H (in the sense that it intersects H at exactly 2 points, since H is convex), then L will forever remain ‚Äúinside‚Äù H. Ultimately, L will take a cyclic tour around the inside of H, before returning to the starting pivot P. (Either way, our windmill process works, but it is instructive to consider the difference between L being inside vs outside H for such a simple S, before moving on to more complicated scenarios)<br><br><br>But what if S were to also contain some points either inside or outside of H? For instance, suppose S consists of the vertices of a single equilateral triangle, plus one point (C) in the center of it. Well, if we select P to be one of the vertices, and L to start outside the triangle, then L will forever remain outside the triangle, and will never hit C<br><br>On the other hand, if we select P = C (with L being any line that doesn‚Äôt hit the vertices), then the windmill process actually works out (in fact, we could actually choose any P to be any point of S, so long as we choose L to be inside the triangle, rather than starting outside). I leave it to the reader to ponder/verify this 4 point case, since we are about to show much more general results anyway (this was just an introduction to thinking about the problem)<br><br><br>Lemma 0 (Inside Now = Inside Forever): Let H be a convex polygon, whose vertices are in S. If P is a vertex of H, and L is any line through P that intersects H at more than one point, then the windmill process will leave L ‚Äútrapped‚Äù inside H forever. (That is, L will always intersect H at more than one point, at every moment, of every rotation about each pivot point)<br><br>Proof: In the intro, we saw how this works when S = H, but what if there are points inside H? (Or even outside, though that won‚Äôt actually matter)<br><br><br><br>Lemma 1: Let H_1 and H_2 be two convex polygons, whose vertices are in S, such that H_1 is contained in the interior of H_2. If P is a vertex of H_1, and L is any line that intersects H_1 only at P, then the windmill process on P and L will force L inside of H_1 (after a finite number of steps), and <br><br><br>Edit: If you‚Äôre reading this sentence, then I haven‚Äôt finished writing yet‚Ä¶ I press submit once in a while to avoid losing anything, so please come back in a couple hours üôÇ",2023-11-09T20:59:02Z

Think about what makes the surface of the mug (or a doughnut) distinct from that of a sphere, and how <i>that</i> affects the argument.  I think I went years knowing that Euler&#39;s formula looks different on different surfaces but had never really thought through why.  In particular, the exercise will set good intuitions for learning about homology, if that&#39;s something in your future.<br><br>Also, my apologies for two names typos here: Veritasium, and James Grime (evidently I accidentally pluralized him to &quot;Grimes&quot;).

I think of the relationship between watching this series and taking a course as being analogous to the relationship between touring a city vs. living in it.

And that is why use tangent based explanation when a secant based explanation seems more robust with helpful implications going forward regarding discontinuities and so forth?  Plus!  Around a wobble of some sorts in a graph it seems easier to adapt secant as an approximation of tangent at a single point.  Then, perhaps, in a small interval around a single point the secant exists either side of that point.<br>The tangent approach seems naively risky, and some may say there is no harm in that, because it only considers tangent on one side of a point and not other side(s).  and may be extended easier into multiple dimensions too?<br>PS: the example about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly4S0oi3Yz8&amp;t=12m50s"">12:50</a>, to me, is just crying out for secant linearity based on outer two values compared to inner value.",2023-10-08T13:54:37Z

You always look at a problem, read it out loud, then discover something about that problem. It&#39;s like there is always a hidden puzzle in math equations. For example, in 7th grade, we were learning about circumference. My teacher showed the class a video which said that if you take the diameter and try to wrap it around a circle, there&#39;s a tiny bit left, to which I realized that that tiny bit looked EXACTLY like pi, or 3.14. It&#39;s so cool finding small details that make so much since!",2023-12-19T07:19:41Z

It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  You should know, though, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.

Really it should be ceil(pi/theta) - 1, to account for the cases where pi/theta is an integer.  For example, when the mass ratio is 1, theta will be pi/4, so pi/theta is 4, but there are 3 clacks.  As stated in the video, though, you still think about this is &quot;how many times can you add theta to itself before it surpasses (or equals) pi?&quot;<br><br><br>2) What I animate here as I say &quot;angle of reflection&quot; and &quot;angle of incidence&quot; differs a little with convention.  Typically in optics, you look at the angle between the beam and a line <b>perpendicular</b> to the mirror, rather than with the mirror itself.<br><br>3) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) ‚âà x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>4) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  This is common in the context of math, but you should know, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we did here.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed this little sequence.  I still get happy whenever I think about the phenomenon and the various explanations for it.",2019-04-22T22:03:38Z

I have a naive question: we stated that when the polarized light goes through the solution, certain wavelengths get rotated more than others. However, if we were to look at the end of the pole, we would still observe white light, indicating that the superposition is similar to the initial linearly polarized light. Is it expected or intuitive that the superposition of the income light that is in the same plane should be the same as the superposition of the wavelengths that are rotated and are in different planes?

In the graphic the viewer is shown very close to a very large tube,  which makes up maybe 40 degrees of their field of view. This would correspond to a large change in perceived angle by the viewer, and would be a plausible explanation for the strips.<br><br> In the actual video though the tube is very small compared to the field of view of the camera, it maybe makes up a 3 or four degree angle for the field of view. This would correspond to an equally small change in perception of the direction the light is polarized, again maybe 3 or 4 degrees. (Comparing the top of the tube to the bottom in a vertical strip).  Lets compare that to the visual evidence we see in the video.<br><br>We see the light go through nearly a full rotation as it travels through the length of the tube, meaning it changes its angle about 300-400 degrees along the full length of the tube.  (for one wavelength of light, each wavelength having a unique total change in angle as we saw). <br><br>Just from eyeballing it, it looks like the bands of equal intensity light travel about a sixth to a quarter of the tube as they go from the top of the tube to the bottom. From my earlier aprox that would correspond to somewhere around a 50 degree change in perceived polarization angle from the top to the bottom, because our percieved polar angle is shifted this much as we go from the top to the bottom of a vertical slice.  (and 50 is 1/6 of 350). <br><br>This is very wishy washy and just form me eyeballing the footage, and I could just have a critical error in my reasoning but that seems wayy to drastic of a difference, (a  50 degree visual approx to the 2-5 percent angle I think we would see just from perception reasons) Let me know if I am misunderstanding or f you think there might be more to this.<br><br>That said I have a degree in physics and this was a better explanation of light waves than I got my entire college study, love the channel and the vid.",2023-12-15T06:55:25Z

There is one thing I&#39;m still confused about though, if anyone is willing to help me understand. So if I&#39;m understanding correctly, different frequencies of light are slowed down by different amounts because of differences in how they make the particles inside the glass oscillate. One color will make the particles wiggle at it&#39;s specific frequency, and the amplitude will vary based on that frequency. This explanation makes perfect sense to me for a beam of a single color being bent differently from others, but how can this happen simultaneously for all frequencies in white light to achieve the effect of a prism? How can the single layer of particles be oscillating at multiple frequencies at once? Are the waves just added together? and if so wouldn&#39;t the net effect of those oscillations affect all of the frequencies of light? I&#39;m assuming the way the math works out you can just think of the frequencies all acting independently even though they&#39;re in reality added together, but I&#39;m a bit unsure why this would be, and I may just be missing something entirely.",2023-12-16T23:33:37Z

UgwgVl3eqdCvXWce23R4AaABAg,@groovyfan,,1,Cz4Q4QOuoo8,0,0,2023-12-21T22:12:45Z,"1) Some people have asked about if the tan(x) ‚âà x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count.  It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  You should know, though, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we do next video.",2023-12-21T22:12:45Z

Isn&#39;t that the square root of zero?  (Actually, it&#39;s a great way to start a proof that ends with division by zero - a vertical line, and corresponds to what I call Doyle&#39;s constant that deals with a brief window in time starting with taking the eth root of e and ending with a vertical line.  Delanges sectrices for the unflaking of dark matter, Archimedean spiral for spinning up dark matter, Ceva sectrices for that dark matter breaking into smaller, primordial dark matter and black holes, Dinostratus quadratrix for impacting surrounding black holes, and Maclaurin sectrices for dark matter being slowed down over time.  Split-complex at one, noting the more gravitational nature of diagonal ring/cylinder singularities of baryonic matter from broken dark matter.  Using repetitious bisection (from arbitrary angle trisection), one gets added (SSA) for when dark matter dominates a universe and one gets added for when black holes and rarified singularities make things more gravitational, leading to a Big Crunch.  At 2 = a Big Crunch, the solution to the Basel problem, and the &quot;bellows method&quot; drives things.  A Big Crunch event needs the net gravity from the localized area AND gravitational effects from surrounding universes.  The 2 represents how locked up black holes are making a stacking, planar contact.  Everything else are harmonics - effects on surrounding universes.<br>I see this proof as like trying to climb a steep cliff with the process of dark matter breaking up, getting to the top of the hill (like stable atomic nuclei) and then skiing down the &quot;hill of many black holes&quot; past an inflection point where black hole formation and spaghettification happens, leading to the final vertical line tensor of the Maclaurin trisectrix.  This is much like I have posted about considering the recursive form of Euler&#39;s Identity as being like an old incandescent light bulb that you can see having first, second, and third degree critical points.<br>Ramanujan&#39;s Infinite Sum of negative one-twelfth:  each positional jostling, mass, and gravitational/attractive exchange between universes (defined by Big Bounce events, considering Ramanujan during both Big Crunch and Big Bang sides) ADDS up to evenness (or a partner in marriage - like half of the whole, I guess).<br>Net gravity increases over time from the breaking up of dark matter, much like a vertical asymptote.  It continues to increase, but hits a critical point, much like a vertical tangent, when enough dark matter has weakened and been broken up into the more gravitational baryonic matter (split-complex numbers).  Then, the effects of gravity reach their upper limit - much like a vertical line - at e to the negative e.<br>Over a decade ago, I said that the potential energy of a Big Bang was 1/6 times (the speed of light, cubed).

Out the opposite side of the block, greatly attenuated, came an easily recognizable rendition of Mozart 40... about one-half nanosecond sooner than it &quot;should&quot; have been able to. <br><br>In other words, some tiny fraction of the microwave photons had TUNNELLED through the solid metal, <b>faster than light.</b> In that example, Nimtz claimed &quot;only&quot; <b>four point seven times c,</b> because of his experimental limits on precision, but other experimenters have greatly exceed that rate. Within experimental limits, tunneling takes approximately ZERO TIME. Those experiments do not prove &quot;time travel&quot; but they do demonstrate FTL communication. So to all the dogmatists, there it is: QED!<br><br>I note that objections based on the notion of &quot;causality violation&quot; are an example of <i>flawed logic.</i> Such objections are not at all relevant, since causality violation is <i>incorrectly assumed</i> to result from anything going faster than c.

The polarization rotation causes a gradient fade as you rotate them approaching perpendicular.  The 3rd simply counterrotates that partially between the fore and aft ones, allowing some of the light to go through again.<br><br>Think of it this way: your hole is vertical one side and horizontal the other side.  If you are completely perpendicular then only an infinitesimal amount of you can get through, if it&#39;s on an angle, then some of you can get through.  You get turned sideways going through the first, then the second one puts you back the other way somewhat, and that gives you enough to go through the last one diagonally.  That&#39;s just analogy, as nothing is actually trying to travel from somewhere to somewhere else through oddly shaped holes.<br><br>Linear polarization is merely a phase match of 2 rotations, and the filters offset these phases to affect apparent wave amplitude, they do not actually &quot;block light&quot; as if it was something travelling from somewhere to somewhere else.  Light is merely the medium oscillating, similar to sound.  I do not know what causes the assumption of light being &quot;absorbed&quot; on certain axes (you&#39;d have to observe proportional heating on the surfaces of the filters, ie if you have 2 filters and &quot;block&quot; the light completely, they should heat proportionally to 100% of the energy of the light that would go through them if they were actually blocking or absorbing).",2023-09-02T01:14:21Z

The particle/wave duality is key to understanding the limits of range ambiguity resolution as an analogy to quantum physics because it introduces this mysterious and strange aspect of quantum mechanics. The problem in measuring the plane lies with the radar.

For example, for turbulent flow over a flat plate, you would consider the characteristic length L as being the length of the plate. Then the upper bound of the inertial subrange is about 1/6 L, and the lower bound is about 60 L (œÅUL/¬µ)^(-3/4), where œÅ is the density of the fluid, U is the mean velocity over the plate, and ¬µ is the flow viscosity. Altogether Re = œÅUL/¬µ is the Reynolds number.<br>What defines this range, is that the kinetic energy only cascades down, but it isn&#39;t produced (like at bigger scales) neither dissipated (like at smaller scales).",2022-09-13T01:39:56Z

But when we say incompressible flow, it&#39;s important to consider the speed of the flow, and the pressure gradients associated with it. For many applications, with no pressure gradients (like in external flow, like the one shown in the footage) and with speeds well below the speed of sound (definitely like shown in the footage), compressibility effects are quite negligible. So although air is compressible, for external flow, and low Mach numbers, the incompressibility hypothesis is really reasonable.",2022-09-13T01:24:36Z

This continuous velocity change creates vortex, which also produces pseudo centrifugal force. The vortex which is particles flowing in continuous change in velocity has an interesting property in which  the speed compared to its size (in ratio) will be surprisingly constant. The velocity is direct and positively proportional to the size of the vortex. <br><br>The vortex in this context is similar to centrifugal force but it&#39;s radius will get smaller as time passes, for the reason why, centrifugal force radius will stay constant and it&#39;s velocity slow down overtime. This will be due to the change in velocity forms a circle at which the distanced traveled at full turn will be 2*pi*r, the circumference of a circle. Removing the radius would give 2*pi, in radians, this is 360 degrees. Dividing it in half would still form a circle if many of it is put together. That&#39;s why centrifugal force is relatively stable, but for the vortex found in turbulent force, it would be quite unstable. Centrifugal force at 1/4 turn would have a 90 degrees or pi/2 in radians but vortex at 1/4 turn would be 95 degrees or 5/3 in radians. The particles at the edge of the vortex would get knocked of making the radius of the vortex get slower overtime.<br><br>This can be observed in turbulent flows at which a particle would change its velocity potentially hitting another particle and that other particle will also change velocity in which the number of collisions increases exponentially and there would be particles forming vortex which could start at any size and slowly decrease in size, or collide with other vortex. The particles that is knocked out of the vortex could potentially form smaller or larger vortex. <br><br>But it might seem that some vortexes would get bigger but it is not really getting bigger. The force is just strong enough that knocked out particles have their velocity change differ quite slightly compared to those particles found in the vortex due to inertia. <br><br>By this, turbulent flow is a state of flow that the velocity of the particles changes continuously and the number of collisions increases exponentially producing vortexes that dissipate over time as long as there&#39;s no significant energy being added/harnessed. <br><br>What you might find mind-blowing in this is that centrifugal force is stable in which at 1/4 turn is 90 degrees, vortext is unstable because it&#39;s more than 90 degrees so it&#39;s radius slowly decreases. So what if the degree is lesser than 90 degrees?

Diffusion can occur with no fluid motion at all.  Diffusion occurs in laminar flow too.  Diffusion happens according to Fick&#39;s Laws and is driven by concentration gradients.  Dispersion is far more powerful in mixing the dye in a turbulent flow field than diffusion.   Use of a plane of laser to visual turbulence is similar to an old technique called Schlieren, which examined the shadows of that the eddies (smoke) makes.  It has been used to formally study certain terms in the reduced Navier-Stokes equations.  As to when turbulence is initiated, the Reynolds number is used (in honour of Osborne R.).  If the Re number is high enough, laminar flow is difficult or impossible to exist or maintain.  The characteristic length term that is within the expression for the Reynolds Number (ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces) is chosen according to the situation or object being studied.  It would be the diameter of the sphere that the fluid is moving past, in the case of a sphere, and the turbulent threshold is a low value of Re.",2022-01-20T12:47:25Z

Ultimately, we will take a nested sequence of convex hulls. Each time we find a new hull H, we will remove the points of S that live on the boundary of H (which are exactly the vertices of H), then take the convex hull of the remaining points. Eventually, we will be left with a set of 0-2 points that cannot form any further hulls (call this set Z), and we will be left with a single, smallest convex hull, call it H*<br><br>Select P to be any vertex of H* (which must be in S), and L to be any line that goes through the inside of H* (for sake of simplicity, we can choose L such that it does not intersect any other points of S, since S is finite). After that, our ‚Äúwindmill‚Äù process will force L to stay inside of H* forever, in the sense that the intersection of L with H* will always be a nontrivial line segment (i.e., not a single point). Furthermore, L will hit every point of S infinitely many times (including the points of Z), all while remaining ‚Äúlocated‚Äù inside of H*‚Ä¶ Proof to follow<br><br><br>First, consider the scenario where the points of S happen to form a single convex polygon, call it H for Hull. Then we can simply take P to be any point of S, and L can essentially be any line (though for simplicity, suppose we avoid lines that hit any of the other vertices). If this line L is completely outside H (in the sense that it only intersects H at P), then the windmill process will simply take L on a cyclic tour around the outside of H, eventually arriving back at our starting pivot P. (Feel free to consider small examples of 2-4 points for a moment to see this)<br><br>On the other hand, if L begins ‚Äúinside‚Äù H (in the sense that it intersects H at exactly 2 points, since H is convex), then L will forever remain ‚Äúinside‚Äù H. Ultimately, L will take a cyclic tour around the inside of H, before returning to the starting pivot P. (Either way, our windmill process works, but it is instructive to consider the difference between L being inside vs outside H for such a simple S, before moving on to more complicated scenarios)<br><br><br>But what if S were to also contain some points either inside or outside of H? For instance, suppose S consists of the vertices of a single equilateral triangle, plus one point (C) in the center of it. Well, if we select P to be one of the vertices, and L to start outside the triangle, then L will forever remain outside the triangle, and will never hit C<br><br>On the other hand, if we select P = C (with L being any line that doesn‚Äôt hit the vertices), then the windmill process actually works out (in fact, we could actually choose any P to be any point of S, so long as we choose L to be inside the triangle, rather than starting outside).

The introduction of this unit makes all non-constant polynomial equations solvable in the field of complex numbers (see fundamental theorem of algebra).<br>The formula contains an irrational power (the Neperian irrational number e, raised to an exponent containing the irrational factor pi), is rare in mathematical formulae. It connects real irrational numbers (e), imaginary irrational numbers (pi), and integers (1).<br>Furthermore, all the fundamental operators of arithmetic are present: equality, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. All the basic assumptions of complex analysis are present, and the integers 0 and 1 are related to the field of complex numbers.<br>(source: wiki)<br><br><br>The mathematical analogy seems to me thus instituted with a philosophical theorem of creation. It could be the following:<br>the world (the created universe) adds nothing to God, and this can be represented by Euler&#39;s identity.<br>&quot;To create is to continually create new&quot;<br>[Luther, Resolutions on Indulgences (WA I, p.563)].<br>&quot;If you try to subtract the Spirit from creation, all things mix and their life appears without law, without order, without any determination&quot;<br>[Basil the Great, Of the Holy Spirit, XVI, 38 (PG 32, 137 B].<br>&quot;Without the Spirit, the whole of creation cannot last&quot; (Ambrogio, Dello Spirito Santo, II, 5, 33).<br>&quot;The universe was about to fall back into chaos and dissolve in dismay in the face of passion if the great Jesus had not poured out the divine spirit of him, exclaiming:&quot; Father, into your hands I commend my Spirit &quot;(Lk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvmuCPvRoWQ&amp;t=23m46s"">23:46</a>) . And immediately, with the diffusion of the divine Spirit, as revived, quickened and consolidated, the universe found its stability&quot;<br>[Ancient Easter homily, 55 (SCh 27, p. 183)]<br><br>So, finally,  considering in a hierarchical steps the  four main disciplines of human endeavors, we could state an interdisciplinary comment like that.<br>The word poetry means &quot;making&quot;, literally ‚Äì poiesis. Poetry is fundamental speech. Prose is less fundamental speech. Prose is fallen poetry; poetry is not decorated prose. The original language, for Heidegger and for Lewis in The Magician&#39;s Nephew, was music. Now music usually has words, so words are in the music. But those words are words for music. Take them out of the music and they&#39;re still poetry, but make them fall one step further and they&#39;re prose. Make them fall one step further and they&#39;re mathematics, which is the only univocal, unambiguous language in the world. The most ambiguous language in the world is music. And therefore it&#39;s the richest. How will the tower of Babel be undone; how will we understand each other in heaven? Will we all speak English, or Dutch? No, we&#39;ll all speak music.",2023-07-01T08:41:27Z

And so is the width. So the area is a simple multiplication.<br><br>But in the case of a sphere, that length is a diameter of a circle, which has expanded left and right (one dimension), as well as forward and backwards (another dimension) in all possible ways you can turn.<br><br>Like a wave that forms when a stone is dropped in a pond of calm water. That circle has stretched out by its diameter. <br>And that diameter is our length. <br><br>If a circle has stretched out left and right, forward and backwards, that means the only other dimension left is up and down. <br>Meaning the circle can be flipped or rotate up and down.<br><br>So here&#39;s the question with area of a sphere.<br>How many times did a diameter of a circle which goes left and right, forward and backward, repeat itself in going up and down.<br><br>To visualize this...<br>Picture one circle, let&#39;s call it Circle A, with a diameter that goes left and right, forward and backwards. <br>Imagine that circle A is fitted inside another circle, let&#39;s call it Circle B with a diameter that goes up and down. <br><br>Now keep on drawing more circles like Circle A, as if to get a picture by picture rendition of rotating circle A around circle B provided they all fit in circle B, and it won&#39;t be long before you notice that you&#39;re tracing out the circumference of Circle B. <br><br>Equally so, you&#39;ll notice that there will be two ends of circle A, that will not rotate and will stay fixed. These two connected, form your diameter, such that if you&#39;re rotating circle A in circle B, there will be two points in circle A, that will not touch circle B and will stay fixed throughout the rotation. <br>The distance between these two points is what we are measuring the repetition of. <br><br>And so a very logical definition based meaning is that how many times did we repeat that diameter in going up and down. <br><br>Diameter is 2r. And the circumference is 2œÄr...<br>Multiply these two and you get your surface area. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if any of this made sense, but I&#39;m putting it out here to whoever will understand or care.<br><br>Aight!",2023-12-19T20:23:00Z

We know the derivative (in proper context) is the slope of the tangent line, and the slope of a line is the change in y per unit change in x. Looking at clumps of points near the input, is just looking at points separated by dx, as opposed to separated by 1, so the change in clumping is just approximately f&#39;(x)*dx.

Make the jewels into colored segments, then connect the ends of the string together to make a circle. Then pick a color and find the centroid of all the segments of that color (the circle excluding the segments of the other color). This gives you a point where all of the lines that go through it split the color 50%. Then make a line that goes through the center of the circle and the centroid of one of the colors. This splits the circle 50% and also the proportions of the gems are equal on both sides, so you can mark where the line cuts the circle and undo the string connection. This gives 2 cuts at most for the 2-jewel problem. Maybe this can be generalized.",2023-05-12T22:49:46Z

I tap out the abbreviated version in case it is of interest. Problem: kid carrying a 5-foot metal post wants to board a bus. Bus driver says &#39;no carry on items over 3 feet in any dimension allowed&#39;. What is the kid to do? Solution: Of course the kid ducks into a (say FedX) shipping store and purchases a 3 x 3 x 3 foot box. Now the kid is depending on the bus driver to use the implicit box-based coordinate system. Extension: Suppose FedX has started selling 4D boxes. Or 20-dimensional boxes. Is it true that the kid can purchase a very &quot;small&quot; box -- say 4 inches on a side for each of 20 dimensions where this box will accommodate the five foot post?,2023-08-03T18:16:03Z

The transformation must then only affect the other dimension of the plane hence why the slice of a cylinder is always a cone. Tried to generalize to points that are not infinitely far away but not sure how to do it. I think it has something to do with how the direction of the plane that is preserved under projection from a point at infinity now changes a little because of the slant of the cone.,2023-11-24T21:38:03Z

It&#39;s actually a very interesting answer!  I really went back and forth on whether or not to include this in the video but decided to leave it out to better keep things to the point.  This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>2) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  You should know, though, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we do next video.",2019-02-09T02:01:39Z

Just because a sequence of numbers is infinite does not mean that it contains every imaginable combination of numbers. For example, there is an infinity of numbers between 1 and 0. There&#39;s .0001, there&#39;s 1/3, you got pi over ten, etc. Yet, even given the infinite count of numbers you get between 0 and 1, you can never get any number larger than one. There is an infinite number of numbers, yet not all numbers are included. So even though Pi is irrational, I don&#39;t think it necessarily means that you get every possible combination of digits. In fact, since by the very definition of it being infinite we can never create all of its digits, there will always be some combination of digits that we cannot give a proof for being included in pi.",2019-02-25T02:54:21Z

This difference between arctan(x) and x could be problematic for our final count if, at some point when you&#39;re looking at the first 2n digits of pi, the last n of them are all 9&#39;s.  It seems exceedingly unlikely that this should be true.  For example, among the first 100 million digits of pi, the maximal sequence of consecutive 9&#39;s has length 8, whereas you&#39;d need a sequence of 50 million for things to break our count!  Nevertheless, this is quite difficult to prove, related to the question of whether or not pi is a &quot;normal&quot; number, roughly meaning that it&#39;s digits behave like a random sequence.  It was left as a conjecture in Galperin&#39;s paper on the topic.  See sections 9 and 10 of that paper (linked in the description) for more details.<br><br>4) A word on terminology:  I tend to use the word ‚Äúphase space‚Äù to describe any space like the ones described in this video and the last, encoding some state of some system.  This is common in the context of math, but you should know, that often in the context of mechanics, this term is reserved for the special case of a space which encodes both the positions and the momenta of all the objects involved.  For example, in that setting, the ‚Äúphase space‚Äù here would be four-dimensional, where the four coordinates represent the position and momentum of each pair of blocks.  The term ‚Äúconfiguration space‚Äù, in contrast, just refers to one where the coordinates describe the positions of all the objects involved, which is what we did here.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed this little sequence.  I still get happy whenever I think about the phenomenon and the various explanations for it.",2019-04-22T22:03:38Z

Also, the connection to ternary counting seemed much more obvious this time than the connection to binary counting in the last video (which I still don&#39;t entirely understand) did. The only issue is that the solution to the constrained version takes so long that I forgot which way I was trying to go halfway through.

Now I think about it though, I really shouldn&#39;t have had to do that, so my solution probably wasn&#39;t actually minimal. I probably made it take much longer by doing that.)

He may be both wrong and right that certain numbers&#39; &quot;simplicity&quot; makes them more &quot;pleasurably discernible&quot; (to paraphrase Wilhelm Reich, at least in the world I imagine, in which his papers at Harvard---which I have never read, and for whose preservation I would love to raise money, as well as Goedel and perhaps Hans Hartmann). At least that is how I interpret his comments about chords.  I think he is right that they are more salient to the ear and more pleasurable, but it is NOT because they are simpler.  Is is because they correspond to familiar pattern or shapes that we have experienced phenomenologically.  This is a line of thinking that Bion pursued when he tried to combine math and psychoanalysis. For example, one can legitimately define an ellipse as a set of points for which the following is true.  Anytime they wander farther from point A, they get closer to point B.  Or something really close to the, which My Current Partner (hereinafter, MCB, an expert on Goedel and Zermelo who has not yet written an article exclusively on Hausdorff, although I am trying to incite him to do so, on a subject of his choice----a request I consider &quot;in frame&quot; under the circumstances, and by my birthday would be joyous).  Anyhow this sounds to layhuman ideas a lot like a family, whose children evolve by orbiting the two parents, continually growing closer to one (literally or metaphorically) while of necessity growing farther from the other, in spiraling circles of abstraction and repetition, for ever.  In traditional societies this was implicitly understood, but in the West we have forgotten how to keep that cycle of learning going.  Anyhow that is just an example of what I mean, and I know I am exaggerating the phenomenon----but that makes it easier to understand and is useful in discussion.  The point I want to leave potential interlocutors with is that this video is both right and wrong about certain numbers being simpler.  They are ones we know how to feel about.  Ones that are associated with pleasure or pain or discmfort, which are cultural matters.  Music varies by culture---Chinese opera sounds awful to a lot of Western earns, and vice versa I imagine.   So the first thing that occurred to me when I watched this video was that I hope very much that the rest of the video explores the cultural variation in what is considered simple.   I would guess that Asian mathematicians would define it differently from Islamic or German ones---in other words, Euler, Brahmagupta, and Omar Khayyam would not have agreed on what &quot;simple&quot; numbers were, and the dream of my life would be to somehow incite a re-imagining (or a restoration, if it ever occurred) of a conversation like that.  I want to get help through my current partner in identifying any lost correspondences and recreating them,  Note:  this idea was prompted by my conversations with a friend who writes fiction under the name sydney pascale.  She floated with me the idea of writing a novel based on the idea that Appolonious corresponded with Cleopatra, and may even have been her lover  Apparently there is some flimsy bit of scholarship that links names like theirs which gave rise to this idea, although obviously the chronology and history make this impossible.) She had this crazy idea that  their pillow talk included both the planning of battle strategy and some of his most interesting work on conics.  Highly unlikely that novel will ever get written or published but sharing just in case. :)",2023-07-05T01:11:13Z

Since no musical instrument produces perfect sine waves, they all produce a fundamental tone (sine wave) and an infinite series of harmonics with frequencies, which are generally all integer multiples of the fundamental tone frequency. <br>Two notes sound harmonious when their *harmonics overlap in frequency*. That is why a major fifth is so dominant in western music. If the ratio is close to 3/2 it means that the 2nd harmonic of the upper note has the same frequency as the 3rd harmonic of the lower note. This is true for every harmonious musical pair. The reason why large denominator ratios sound bad is that the harmonics that overlap are large multiples of the note frequencies and most of the time inaudible (human hearing is quite limited for high frequencies). <br>To illustrate this take the most basic chord in western music, the major chord. It has a root note like C, a major third above it- E in this example and a major fifth G in this example. <br>The ratios would be 5/4 between E and C and 3/2 between G and C. This means all harmonics of the C divisible by 3 would coincide with harmonics of the E harmonics and all harmonics divisible by 5 would be covered by the G harmonics making the chord very pleasant to the ear. In contrast a minor chord, which has an E sharp instead of an E has a much larger denominator ratio and therefore needs much higher harmonics to overlap and sounds much less harmonious.",2023-06-16T22:01:25Z

Thus we can form arbitrarily small covers over each Q, and sum each one - we can do so since we know what a converging series is. And since the covers are arbitrarily small, our converging sum will also be arbitrarily small. <br><br>Going backward, we can further motivate the idea of using open covering that are not necessarily disjoint by looking at Lebesgue&#39;s definition of the measure. If we can find the smallest value of the sum of lengths of covers on Q, we have the outer measure of Q (which turns out to be a valid measure when defined on the borel set on R of which Q belongs to.)

First of all, there are special words for the things you called &quot;harmonious&quot; and &quot;cacophonous&quot;, they are &quot;consonance&quot; and &quot;dissonance&quot; respectively. Secondly, and more interesting, I can explain why certain ratios of notes sound consonant. You&#39;re on the right lines thinking in terms of the &quot;patterns&quot; of the &quot;beats&quot; in the individual waves, but it&#39;s more beautiful than that. When two regular rhythms overlap with a simple ratio (eg. 3:4) it is called a &quot;polyrhythm&quot; in music theory. Depending on the ratio, the combined pattern will itself repeat with some frequency which is less than or equal to the lowest frequency of the two notes, for dissonant intervals this combined frequency is often much lower in pitch than either of the two source notes and not really audible, but more generally this &quot;extra&quot; note of a frequency we can hear, and this effectively introduces a third note into any interval. The trick is that extra note may or may not itself have a simple relationship to the other two notes! Take the example of a perfect fifth, specifically let&#39;s use the notes C and G. The higher note (G) has a frequency 1.5 times the lower note (C), a ratio of 3:2. This means that the combined pattern repeats with a frequency exactly half of the lower note. Halving or doubling the frequency of a note just gives the same note in a lower or higher octave respectively, so in the case of C and G, the &quot;extra note&quot; is actually another C, just one octave lower. This result is at the heart of how consonance works. In much the same way, the &quot;combined note&quot; of a major third (eg. C and E) is also the same as the root note, this time it&#39;s two octaves lower, but it&#39;s still a C, and this why perfect fifths and major thirds are arguably the most consonant intervals. A minor third on the other hand, let&#39;s say A and C, will &quot;resolve&quot; to a note which is neither A nor C, in fact it is F. This is essentially why minor thirds are not quite as consonant as major thirds, but it&#39;s actually still fairly good in this case. The note F is at least part of the A minor scale, and has strong relations to the note A (major third in fact). So there is still a kind of internal consistency which makes it sound good, just not quite as good as a perfect fifth. If you take a very dissonant interval instead, such as a semitone (eg. C and C#) with a ratio close to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=16m15s"">16:15</a> then combined (resolved) frequency is 16x lower (4 octaves) than the higher (C#) note, in fact an 12TET semitone is not exactly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyW5z-M2yzw&amp;t=16m15s"">16:15</a> and the resolved note is even more out of tune with the two source notes. For an irrational ratio with no good nearby rational approximation, the combined rhythm technically never repeats. I have only mentioned two-note intervals for simplicity but this model really shines when you consider more complex chords. Every pair of notes within a given chord interact with each other to form a kind of &quot;high speed polyrhythm&quot; which itself has some frequency of repetition. For a triad, you have 3 source notes and 3 &quot;extra&quot; notes from the combinations. The relationship between all SIX of these notes is what drives the character of the chord. A major triad for example C, E, and G is extremely consonant because all 3 &quot;extra notes&quot; resolve to C (C4+E4=C1, E4+G4=C2, C4+G4=C3)",2023-04-10T20:03:26Z

The operation modulo, or in the video &quot;mod&quot; achieves 2 things:<br><br>1) it reduces a whole number, no matter how small or large to a residue.<br><br>2) that residue is automatically between 0 and your modulo.<br><br>You essentially reduce all numbers to a residue between 0 and your modulo.

In other words, the equal distribution should be a property of the modulo operation itself in any unchanging, regular counting system with any unchanging base.

So basically, It made the decision on how much percent the pattern appear base on previous input. And in the process of making a decision, neurons which have the most weight is the most important input in making a decision. So the more green the weight is, the more important of the neuron in the process of determing the percent. And reverse for red weight. So back to your question, we want to identify the edge pattern(which is a white line and the surrounding will be black pixel), so the middle pixel have to be the brightest and the surrounding will be darkest.

But surely the theory described in the video of edges combining to form shapes, require the shape layer to be dependent not on a linear combination of the ‚Äúedges‚Äù in the previous layer, but instead the relationship between the edges. For an example, looking at the circular shape in a 9, the right circular edge of the second layer should only count for anything in the third layer, if there is also some sort of connection to the right edge (represented in the second layer) present.

Intelligence is not stored data and an architecture to relate and access it. Look at it this way... a person is not &quot;intelligent&quot; because of basic network wiring in their brain. Rather their intelligence stems from two cells (egg and sperm) which propagate and self assemble into a complex organism that it self can observe and manipulate the world around it. That is intelligence. We are so far off from creating something like that and touting that a &quot;neural network&quot; is a key component or accelerator to general AI is pure fantasy.,2023-11-24T05:02:10Z

The other showed 25 defects from a random sample of 400 (6.25%).  Yet, the proportions_ztest() function in Python says that there is no statistical difference, and consequently it is not worth the money to look into whether the two lines are different or to improve the one that has a higher percentage of defects.  While I understand that the 2 different samples are random, and may just have these defect rates by accident, and that these rates are not indicative of the &quot;population,&quot; it still seems counterintuitive.

I am eager to hear insightful responses on this matter. In my view, the best approach to uncover meaningful patterns from feeding complex inputs into the zeta function may be to use a split screen: the left side could show the complex plane with dots of particular colors denoting complex inputs, while the right side maps those inputs through the zeta function, using the same colors to connect inputs to outputs. This visualization may reveal salient correspondences and patterns. The name &quot;1blueComplexInput1blueComplexOutput&quot; reflects this color-coded mapping of complex numbers. I believe this technique will yield valuable insights, patterns, and formulas relating complex inputs to outputs of this profound mathematical function. What are your thoughts on this proposed approach? I welcome your perspectives.

further, the other alleged tense markers, &#39;-ed&#39; and &#39;-ing&#39;, can appear on adjectives and nouns as well. not to mention, the &#39;simple present tense&#39; is used to talk about things that are timelessly true, which by definition means it&#39;s not a tense. and &#39;-ed&#39; and &#39;-ing&#39; can appear with a past, present or future reference, so they obviously don&#39;t indicate tense either.<br><br>methinks similar things are going on with mathematics. the reason things seem so weird to you is that the rules you&#39;ve put your confidence in are simply wrong.<br><br>and honestly, it&#39;d be very weird if this weren&#39;t the case. for the most part, this type of mathematics derives from a roughly 50 year spurt of innovation in the early and mid-1800s, which strongly corresponds with the period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the Unification of Germany and the formation of the Kingdom of Italy. following this period of innovation was a period of codification, wherein we get figures like Georg Cantor, Giuseppe Peano, Richard Dedekind, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, etc. and the goal was to reformulate mathematics to encapsulate everything that was newly discovered in the early years of the 19th century. this period of codification ran roughly from the time of the Unification of Germany to the First World War.<br><br>after this, the major players in the mathematics industry suffered so many losses that it&#39;s accurate to say that we&#39;re looking at a mass extinction event in, not only mathematics, but across the sciences in general. in the wake of which the Vienna Circle grew to prominence, and with the rise of National Socialism, disbanded across the globe. where their ideology took hold just in time to seed the generation that would repopulate these industries after the second wave of mass extinction occurred during WWII. out of this we actually even specifically get Kuhn, who saw precisely what I&#39;m describing, but misinterpreted it as being about the quality of ideas, rather than repopulation events. but all of his examples of revolutions come immediately after horrendous wars, like Newton&#39;s rise in the immediate aftermath of the English Civil War.<br><br>and this pattern is in fact so robust that French mathematicians in the interwar period, recognizing that they were mostly students, largely ignorant of the nuances of the discoveries of the 19th century, came together and formed Nicolas Bourbaki in order to preserve what fragmented knowledge they had left between them. and this sets the stage for the era we&#39;re in now, and have been in since about the 1920s. which is an era of popularization.<br><br>so when you review this timeline it should strike you that the major pivotal moments come not due to any specific thing occurring within the field of mathematics, but things occurring in the world of geopolitics. the transition from innovation to codification came not because the innovation reached some specific level of sophistication, but because the way people thought about the world, and their place in it, changed. and this era of codification ended not because it was in any way finished, but because WWI happened. and the era of popularization occurred not because the two stages that came before were tidy enough to be disseminated to the masses, but because the risk of forgetting everything was a very real looming threat in the aftermath of WWI and WWII.<br><br>so, it&#39;s an odd position to take to say that this foundation which was hastily patched together by just a few men, under the belief that mathematics should be couched in the language of logic, a belief which was later shown to be misguided, is something that will stand the test of time. because there&#39;s absolutely no evidence supporting that conclusion.",2023-10-08T02:02:11Z

The polarization rotation causes a gradient fade as you rotate them approaching perpendicular.  The 3rd simply counterrotates that partially between the fore and aft ones, allowing some of the light to go through again.<br><br>Think of it this way: your hole is vertical one side and horizontal the other side.  If you are completely perpendicular then only an infinitesimal amount of you can get through, if it&#39;s on an angle, then some of you can get through.  You get turned sideways going through the first, then the second one puts you back the other way somewhat, and that gives you enough to go through the last one diagonally.  That&#39;s just analogy, as nothing is actually trying to travel from somewhere to somewhere else through oddly shaped holes.<br><br>Linear polarization is merely a phase match of 2 rotations, and the filters offset these phases to affect apparent wave amplitude, they do not actually &quot;block light&quot; as if it was something travelling from somewhere to somewhere else.  Light is merely the medium oscillating, similar to sound.  I do not know what causes the assumption of light being &quot;absorbed&quot; on certain axes (you&#39;d have to observe proportional heating on the surfaces of the filters, ie if you have 2 filters and &quot;block&quot; the light completely, they should heat proportionally to 100% of the energy of the light that would go through them if they were actually blocking or absorbing).",2023-09-02T01:14:21Z

Keep in mind that the radar analogy (Range ambiguity resolution) isn&#39;t completely interchangeable with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle/unsharpness relation.

The particle/wave duality is key to understanding the limits of range ambiguity resolution as an analogy to quantum physics because it introduces this mysterious and strange aspect of quantum mechanics. The problem in measuring the plane lies with the radar.

I think when I first heard someone reference fractional dimension like this I just thought it was nonsense, right? I mean, mathematicicans are clearly just making stuff up. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=2m29s"">2:29</a> Dimension is something that usually only makes sense for natural numbers, right? A line is one-dimensional; a plane, that&#39;s two dimensional; this space that we live in, that&#39;s three dimensional, and so on. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=2m38s"">2:38</a> ... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=4m25s"">4:25</a> Typically in math, the word that you use for this is &quot;Measure&quot;, but I think it might be more intuitive to talk about &quot;mass&quot;. As in, image that metal: A thin wire, a flat sheet, a solid cube, and some kind of Sierpinski mesh. Fractual dimension has everything to do with understanding how the mass of these shapes changes as you scale them. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=4m46s"">4:46</a> The benefit of starting the discussion with self-similar shapes is that it gives us a nice clear-cut way to compare masses. When you scale down that line by one half, the mass is also scaled down by one-half, which you can viscerally see because it takes two copies of that smaller one to form the whole. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=5m04s"">5:04</a> When you scale down a square by one-half, its mass is scaled down by one fourth, where again you can see this by piecing together four of the smaller copies to get the original. Likewise, when you scale down that cube by one half, the mass is scalled down by one eithth, or one-half cubed, because it takes eight copies of that. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=5m25s"">5:25</a> ... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=9m12s"">9:12</a> ... What I&#39;ve described so far, everything up to this point is what you might call &quot;self-similarity dimension&quot;. It does a good job making the idea of fractional dimension seem at least somewhat reasonable, but there&#39;s a problem. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=9m26s"">9:26</a>",2023-09-21T11:34:08Z

Walking straight up toward the peak has the two vectors aligned so you get the maximum rise in elevation possible.

Speaking of which (of course not the fault of the video creator) - one thing that bothers me is why do they confuse things in the computer science realm by naming a vector&#39;s dimension after the number of elements in it?  That is so confusing to call what I see as a one dimensional array of numbers (or list of numbers)  an x-dimension vector (where x is the number of elements in the array).  In doing so it completely confuses folks and muddies the water since multiple dimensions in computer science refers to how many types of items you can have, not how many elements under each of those types.  They should have called them elements, as in this would be a 1 dimensional vector with 2 elements: [5, 10].",2023-11-18T06:37:51Z

So my anemic math skills are hampering me in an extremely fast-paced program where it&#39;s like they are speaking a different language every time somebody busts out the Greek letters. Looking up these essential mathematical concepts mostly just brings up <b>how</b> to solve test problems and complete homework, whereas for ML you need to understand <b>why</b> these methods work.

Your rows and columns method is an excellent graphical explanation of what&#39;s going on and the second video does a great job of explaining how easy it is to figure out which bit is in error.   <br><br>My explanation involved assigning the data bits a sequence number from 0 to 15. Parity bit 1 covered all bits with the 1 bit set in their sequence number (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15). Parity bit 2 covers all bits with a 2 bit in their sequence number (2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15). Parity bit 4 covered all bits with a 4 bit set in their sequence number (4,5,6,7,12,13,14,15). Parity bit  8 covers all bits with an 8 bit set in their sequence number (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15). This essentially created a parity check for each column of the bit sequence number and provides an easy way to determine which bit had fipped.   <br><br>If a single bit error occured, to figure out which bit was in error, you simply added up the values of the parity bits that were wrong and it told you exactly which bit needed to be fixed.   Lets say bit 12 had flipped. That would mean the parity calculations associated with parity bits 4 and 8 would be wrong... meaning fix bit 12 (4+8). An error in bit 3 would mean that parity bits 1 and 2 would be wrong indicating bit 3 (1+2) should be fixed.",2023-10-20T13:02:36Z

The introduction of this unit makes all non-constant polynomial equations solvable in the field of complex numbers (see fundamental theorem of algebra).<br>The formula contains an irrational power (the Neperian irrational number e, raised to an exponent containing the irrational factor pi), is rare in mathematical formulae. It connects real irrational numbers (e), imaginary irrational numbers (pi), and integers (1).<br>Furthermore, all the fundamental operators of arithmetic are present: equality, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. All the basic assumptions of complex analysis are present, and the integers 0 and 1 are related to the field of complex numbers.<br>(source: wiki)<br><br><br>The mathematical analogy seems to me thus instituted with a philosophical theorem of creation.

Poetry is fundamental speech. Prose is less fundamental speech. Prose is fallen poetry; poetry is not decorated prose. The original language, for Heidegger and for Lewis in The Magician&#39;s Nephew, was music. Now music usually has words, so words are in the music. But those words are words for music. Take them out of the music and they&#39;re still poetry, but make them fall one step further and they&#39;re prose. Make them fall one step further and they&#39;re mathematics, which is the only univocal, unambiguous language in the world. The most ambiguous language in the world is music.

When people ask a question like that &quot;here is a description of a person is he class A og B&quot;, it is not appropriate at all to assume this is person is randomly sampled from the population. i think what is instead implied, the way most people hear such a question, is that the person is sampled from the archetypes of their respective classes. Eg you take the x most libererian libererians and x most farmer farmers, and pick one. why would you say its eigther a farmer or a liberarian if not. Is a more valid answer that you think hes a teacher because those are more common?<br><br>now i would say as an example to teach bayes theorem, this is not that bad. However many people will use such thought experiments to try to convince people to use a more &quot;logical&quot; mindset. The fact is in the real world when you are faced with a question like that, not asked by someone that designed it to trick you, cleansing your mindset from context, and trying to find a few variables and use math will be less accurate than using your intuition on the whole context of the question asked, why it was asked, who asked, etc.",2023-12-05T18:22:13Z

It seems to just describe a static reality... But the interpretation is a dynamical/iterative scheme to update subjective belief. <br><br>The libertarian-farmer example has a hypothesis that has a well defined prior probability (the fraction of librarian is a objective reality). In other context, the probability about belief is fundamentally ill defined. For instance, the likelihood of string theory is correct (over all current theory) has a definite binary answer while our assignment of prior probability is totally ill defined and subjective... This example is more about updating subjective belief while the librarian-farmer example is more about describing well defined static reality.

So the more green the weight is, the more important of the neuron in the process of determing the percent. And reverse for red weight.

How can this process be entirely linear? Essentially each layer is some linear combination of the previous layer. But surely the theory described in the video of edges combining to form shapes, require the shape layer to be dependent not on a linear combination of the ‚Äúedges‚Äù in the previous layer, but instead the relationship between the edges. For an example, looking at the circular shape in a 9, the right circular edge of the second layer should only count for anything in the third layer, if there is also some sort of connection to the right edge (represented in the second layer) present. Hence, surely this could be more accurately represented by a multiplication of the two second layer neurons instead of a linear combination of them?",2023-11-27T23:59:06Z

Intelligence is not stored data and an architecture to relate and access it. Look at it this way... a person is not &quot;intelligent&quot; because of basic network wiring in their brain. Rather their intelligence stems from two cells (egg and sperm) which propagate and self assemble into a complex organism that it self can observe and manipulate the world around it. That is intelligence. We are so far off from creating something like that and touting that a &quot;neural network&quot; is a key component or accelerator to general AI is pure fantasy.,2023-11-24T05:02:10Z

Even graphically whats mind bending is that rate of change is the difference in height of function at a certain interval and if the interval completley collapse the point is exactly the same so the ratio had to be 0/0 . But it yelids the function  that precisely measures the tangent of slove at that point resolving all our problem. This in itself feels counterintuitive.,2023-11-13T05:39:55Z

Œ¥f/Œ¥x is called the partial derivative of f with respect to x, and it is found in exactly the same way a normal derivative is found, except that we treat y, z and any other variable that f might depend on other than x as constants. The same is true for Œ¥f/Œ¥y and Œ¥f/Œ¥z, with x and z being treated as constants in the first case and x and y as constants in the second case. Now consider S=x^2+y^2. Œ¥S/Œ¥x=2x and Œ¥S/Œ¥y=2y.

It seems like but it will not. From implicit differentiation we have shown that x&#39;=y/x at that time.

In particular I didn&#39;t quite get what is to special about functions presented here so we couldn&#39;t find derivatives as usual. In fact all of them define x vs y relation in some form. For example x^2 + y^2 = 25 is just another way to write y = f(x) = square root of 25 - x^2. It is just so that y is not defined for all values of x (and circle function is in some sense nice visual representation why square root of negative number is not defined).,2023-10-12T14:52:13Z

Follow the full playlist at <a href=""http://3b1b.co/calculus"">http://3b1b.co/calculus</a><br><br>By the way, there is a piece of math, commonly called &quot;non-standard analysis&quot;, which makes infinitesimals a rigorous notion, thereby avoiding the need to use limits.  That is, in the real number system something like 0.000....(infinitely many 0&#39;s)...1 doesn&#39;t make sense, it&#39;s not an actual number.  But the &quot;hyperreal numbers&quot; of non-standard analysis are constructed so as to include a number like this.<br><br>I have no problem with that system.  I think it&#39;s great to invent new math and new number systems meant to rigorously capture a useful intuitive notion, although the construction of the hyperreal numbers requires some questionable usage of the axiom of choice.  But I do think it&#39;s important to first learn about limits, and how mathematicians made sense out of calculus using the standard real number line without resorting to infinitesimals.  It&#39;s not a matter of clinging to old systems, it&#39;s because limits help to gain a deeper appreciation for structure and character of the real numbers themselves, which in turn will help to understand any extension of those numbers.",2017-05-04T16:54:33Z

But if the volume you want to measure starts at, let‚Äôs say, halfway, you need to subtract the area you don‚Äôt want to count from zero to the halfway point.

What you actually get when inserting any(!) bound is the whole area from 0 to this point. If you want not the whole area beause the area starts right of the center, you just have to substract the area up until this point. This happens to cancel out the constant, yes, but &quot;full area minus not wanted area = wanted area&quot; is a more intuitive reason as to why to substract upper minus lower bound.

I personally have never seen this approach to explaining the relationship between diferential calculus (slopes) and Integral calculus (areas).   The usual proofs of the 1st and 2nd Fundemental Theorems of Calculus never made things quite so clear as this.  Those traditional proof seem to be a lot of alebra and formula manipulations.  The  Riemann sums graphs I was shown but that only explained integrals, not how those related to diferental calculus.   And I&#39;ve never been taught to think about the Average Value of f(x).    That I think is key to the relationshp.  <br><br>I would suggest only one thing. Show how the average value of f(x) = sin(x) becomes 2/pi  for x=0 to x=pi and also plot that on the graph of the function.  After I did that myself, things were even clearer. Then show how the area under that line f(x)=2/pi is pi(2/pi) = 2.  Same as the integral of f(x)=sinx becomes F(x)=-cos(x) from x=0 to x=pi.  You do say it and show the equations but a picture is worth a thousand words and perhaps formulas. <br><br>I was so intrigued by this video that I actually set up a spread sheet and tried averaging up 10 evenly spaced sample values of sin(x) between 0 and pi.  Then I tried 20, and 40 just to see how that average converges on 0.63662 = 2/pi.  It wasn&#39;t hard do with Excel.",2023-08-10T09:42:10Z

The most notable example would be in kinematics, with displacement-time graphs. Finding the slope of any point on a distance time graph will tell you the velocity at that point. Since the derivative describes rate of change, and velocity is the rate of which displacement changes over time, the derivative of displacement is velocity. Finding the derivative of velocity will give you acceleration, also because acceleration describes the rate of which velocity changes. <br><br>On the other hand, integrals are the opposite of the derivative, they give you a running total of all the values the function has had to a certain point. Therefore integrals undo derivatives.

Back in the day in college, I could understand how the integral of a function was the area under the curve of that same function between the stated intervals. l also could understand how the derivative of a function gave you an equation for the slope of that function as it varied along the function.  But the fundamental theory of calculus was a bit of a mystery.  The integral (area) was the exact opposite of the derivate (the slope).  Huh?  Whatever.  I know the rules and can pass the test.  Sadly the university system sets things up such that students who fall back on that will succeed.  I tried to avoid just doing that and I did in a lot of cases, but it cost me time that did not help me get higher grades. Time is precious to a college student and I had to, absolutely had to fall back on that reality.  Learn the mechanics and methods of all of this.  Primary mission.

UgxrOdviEJVi3W0Ryhd4AaABAg,@topilinkala7651,,1,BLkz5LGWihw,0,1,2021-04-19T10:07:08Z,For best understanding why the derivative of accleration is called jerk imagine a computer driven lathe. To move the tool to position you want smooth movement so that the tool does not break. If your movements jerk is too much then the movement is not smooth but it&#39;s jerky. Another example of jerk is in an amusement park. If you ride the coffe cups the movement of those cups have sudden jerks in them and if you graph the movement function and calculate jerk you find out that jerk is high on those parts of the movement. So the name jerk is a very good description what changing acceleration means.<br><br>Btw. Human&#39;s sensory system work well in acceleration and so smooth acceleration does not cause any feelings in itself. For example your inner ear does not react to gravity. A non changing acceleration field does not register. But increase jerk and you inner ear starts to function. That&#39;s why amussement park rides use high jerk to cause effect in humans.,2021-04-19T10:07:08Z

I was always confused about the series during my jee preparation. Teachers weren&#39;t able to answer from where these equations came and it pissed me off so much. Internet was not so prevalent then. What I did back then was to relate the kinematic equation derivation ( from HC verma )  and these series and formulated the taylor series myself. <br><br>if acc is constant<br><br>s = s0 + ut + 1/2 a t^2 <br><br>which is simply the taylor series for displacement<br><br>s = s0 + s&#39; * t + 1/2 * s&#39;&#39; * t^2 <br><br>This way I was also able to solve the questions including jerk ( accn non constant ) by easily writing the equations directly.

We know the derivative (in proper context) is the slope of the tangent line, and the slope of a line is the change in y per unit change in x. Looking at clumps of points near the input, is just looking at points separated by dx, as opposed to separated by 1, so the change in clumping is just approximately f&#39;(x)*dx.

Also, the connection to ternary counting seemed much more obvious this time than the connection to binary counting in the last video (which I still don&#39;t entirely understand) did. The only issue is that the solution to the constrained version takes so long that I forgot which way I was trying to go halfway through.

Now I think about it though, I really shouldn&#39;t have had to do that, so my solution probably wasn&#39;t actually minimal. I probably made it take much longer by doing that.)

Speaking of which (of course not the fault of the video creator) - one thing that bothers me is why do they confuse things in the computer science realm by naming a vector&#39;s dimension after the number of elements in it?  That is so confusing to call what I see as a one dimensional array of numbers (or list of numbers)  an x-dimension vector (where x is the number of elements in the array).  In doing so it completely confuses folks and muddies the water since multiple dimensions in computer science refers to how many types of items you can have, not how many elements under each of those types.  They should have called them elements, as in this would be a 1 dimensional vector with 2 elements: [5, 10].",2023-11-18T06:37:51Z

Of course, the origin has to be the same in both.<br>Another example is if you transformed a 3d game scene into 2d, ignoring the z axis AND converting all the Vector3 types into Vector2 types. The matrix could look something like:<br>| 1  0  0 |<br>| 0  1  0 |<br>3 columns: dim(ColSpace) = 3 -&gt; 3 dimensional input space<br>2 rows: dim(RowSpace) = 2 -&gt; Rank = 2 -&gt; 2 dimensional output space<br><br>I believe this is non-invertible, but I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>Note that this is different from zeroing out all the z axis parts of the Vector3s and keeping them as Vector3s. That would look like:<br>| 1  0  0 |<br>| 0  1  0 |<br>| 0  0  0 |<br>3 columns: dim(ColSpace) = 3 -&gt; 3 dimensional input space.

I have a couple of questions though: <br>1. Do you think that how big the dot product is indicates just how big or little the angle between the vectors is?<br>For instance, if you had two vectors that you took the dot product of, and you got a -6. You would know that the two vectors are going in opposing directions (greater than 90¬∞ between them). If, however, you were to compare this to two other vectors dot product that yielded an answer of -8, could you say that the second set of vectors are definitely more opposed in direction? Or another way of thinking of it: the second set of vectors have a greater degree angle between them than the first set of vectors.<br>2. Could you go further to say that you could even compare two sets of vectors to one another and determine that one of the vectors from the set has the same reference angle as the other?<br>For example:<br>First dot product yields a 7, and the second dot product of two other vectors gives a -7 answer. Does this not indicate that one vector from the first dot product has the same reference angle as one of the vectors from the second dot product.<br><br>Thank you for the video and good information",2023-11-10T02:08:20Z

We want to represent a linear function that when you input a 2d vector you get a scalar. You go from the 2nd dimension to the 1st dimension here. A linear function can be represented as a matrix. A matrix has columns and the columns of the matrix represent the coordinates of the unit basis vector after the linear transformation. Since we want to go from the 2nd dimension to the 1st dimension the matrix will have 2 columns since the vectors in the 2nd dimension have two coordinates which are x and y but will have only 1 row since we want to map the vector into a scalar. To graphically show the coordinates of where these unit basis vectors land after the linear transformation he plugged in a diagonal number line into the plan. Thanks to this number line we can determine where the unit basis vectors land, so we can determine our matrix. But as you can see if you project the the unit basis vector into the number line you can&#39;t determine the coordinates of where the unit basis vector lands because he wants to show the general way to determine them. Since i hat and u hat are both unit vectors (which means that their norm is equal to 1) Projecting one vector to another is gonna be the same because it&#39;s symmetric. So as he mentions, if you want to know where the unit basis vector lands into the line passing by u hat, is the same as knowing where u hat lands when you project it into the line passing by i hat. So the coordinates of i hat after the linear transformation is the x coordinate of u hat. if you do the same reasoning for j hat you will see that the second column of the matrix is gonna be the y coordinate of u hat. Hope it helps.",2023-10-20T15:45:32Z

But I can only make sense of that IF both the vectors lose their one co-ordinate entirely? Like x-coord or y-coord becomes 0.

Could you please clarify this once, I would really appreciate it!<br><br>Edit: To be more concrete, if the transformation causes the new i_hat and j_hat to be linearly dependent, then IFF either of their component is 0, I can see that we can completely move forward, and write the output of applying transform &#39;A&#39; to any vector &#39;v&#39; to be consisting of ONLY one coordinate.

Let x and y be two vectors same size, the notation x^Ty is the dot product between the two vectors. The T means transpose, and when you transpose a vector you get a row vector or a matrix (IN this case a 1x2 matrix). And the point of this video is in fact to demonstrate with some visuals that the corresponding matrix of a vector times a vector (matrix-vector multiplication)  is exactly the same thing as doing the dot product between the two vectors. You can actually demonstrate that on your own and you will see that the computation of a row vector times a vector is the same thing as doing the dot product. So what he is basically saying is that, let x be a vector such as x = [2 ; 3] and y=[y0 ; y1]. To do the dot product between the vectors x and y you can take the transpose of the vector x (the associated matrix) so you have [2;3]^T[y0;y1] or [2;3]‚Ä¢[y0;y1]= 2 X y0 + 3 X y1.<br><br>*Caution*:<br><br>I have introduced the transpose notation here but be aware that doing x^Ty ‚â† xy^T.

You always look at a problem, read it out loud, then discover something about that problem. It&#39;s like there is always a hidden puzzle in math equations. For example, in 7th grade, we were learning about circumference. My teacher showed the class a video which said that if you take the diameter and try to wrap it around a circle, there&#39;s a tiny bit left, to which I realized that that tiny bit looked EXACTLY like pi, or 3.14.

The uber-geniuses of any given age aren&#39;t much impacted by debates like the pi/tau debate, because these debates concern themselves with the difference between two representations that are computationally easy to go between. Thus in the IQ range of 150+, such distinctions make essentially no difference. Now if your IQ is 140 or below, on the other hand, suddenly every CPU cycle has to be treated as really quite precious, and any time spent laboriously transforming between these two viewpoints is time spent not doing productive thinking. So, that&#39;s the secret: the reason the pi/tau debate matters is because these concepts are taught to millions of people with IQ&#39;s in the 70-140 range, and in this range the difference really, really matters. Incidentally, I personally believe that quad = tau/4 = pi/2 = 90 degrees is the correct (read: easiest) constant. So my ranking is this: quad is easiest to understand, tau is second easiest to understand, and pi is the hardest and most confusing of the three.",2023-12-05T06:56:07Z

If it were necessary to be visually-oriented to be a human then your perspective would be fine, but what about people who are congenitally blind - are they not to do mathematics? I was a mathematics teacher in the early part of my career. I am challenged by visual cognition (for example I hate flowcharts, they dont help me think, they hinder). Mathematics is deeper than visual depictions. I think much better withoit them.  In the cases you give here its about relationships and objects (condidering numbers as objects not operations in this case though considering them as operations is also useful). Relationships are always deeper than one view. For this case, who memorises three rules ? To do that is to fail to grasp the relationship - a rule is just one expression of the relationship, its the relationship that carries the meaning - you build the rules when you need them - if you learn the rule you miss out 2/3 of the meaning. Of course ways of thinking are heavily influenced by notations and geometry can provide perspectives we might not reach in other ways but its not the essence, its a manifestation. The essence, as you realise, in this case is one manifestation of a symmetry and we need to think above that. Do students get there via concrete representations (learning rules)? Probably most do but not all and those that do are not doing mathematics. Mathematics is appreciating the relationships and their manifestations and working with them. One rule is not the essence, its a way to approach the essence via its relation to the other rules. Geometry is not the essence either.

We normally draw single variable graphs on two axes, the x axis for a input and the y axis for the output. But that&#39;s not compulsory at all. Its just convenient that&#39;s all. When we move from one variables to two variables, we add another axis, the z axis, to represent and plot our output. But here&#39;s the twist. When we work with complex numbers where both our input and output need two axes each, to represent the real and imaginary parts, we move away from the ideal of adding another axis to represent another variable and instead use two axes to represent the two input variables and one axis and &quot;colour shading&quot; to represent the output variables. See how all of a sudden our attachment towards axes changed. It actually took me a embarrassingly long time to actually grasp this and as a result I could never understand the meaning of a matrix transformation. For me the input and outputs should be located on different, independent axes. <br>Call it a mathematical mental bias of sorts :)",2021-04-20T23:33:53Z

Since we are summing two squares together the smallest term squared (if it is odd) becomes the next term in the partial sum of odd numbers for the larger term to produce the c term. So 3^2+4^2=5^2 is 1+3+5   + 1+3+5+7 = 1+3+5+7+(1+3+5)=1+3+5+7+9,2023-11-08T06:57:57Z

Ultimately, we will take a nested sequence of convex hulls. Each time we find a new hull H, we will remove the points of S that live on the boundary of H (which are exactly the vertices of H), then take the convex hull of the remaining points. Eventually, we will be left with a set of 0-2 points that cannot form any further hulls (call this set Z), and we will be left with a single, smallest convex hull, call it H*<br><br>Select P to be any vertex of H* (which must be in S), and L to be any line that goes through the inside of H* (for sake of simplicity, we can choose L such that it does not intersect any other points of S, since S is finite). After that, our ‚Äúwindmill‚Äù process will force L to stay inside of H* forever, in the sense that the intersection of L with H* will always be a nontrivial line segment (i.e., not a single point). Furthermore, L will hit every point of S infinitely many times (including the points of Z), all while remaining ‚Äúlocated‚Äù inside of H*‚Ä¶ Proof to follow<br><br><br>First, consider the scenario where the points of S happen to form a single convex polygon, call it H for Hull. Then we can simply take P to be any point of S, and L can essentially be any line (though for simplicity, suppose we avoid lines that hit any of the other vertices). If this line L is completely outside H (in the sense that it only intersects H at P), then the windmill process will simply take L on a cyclic tour around the outside of H, eventually arriving back at our starting pivot P. (Feel free to consider small examples of 2-4 points for a moment to see this)<br><br>On the other hand, if L begins ‚Äúinside‚Äù H (in the sense that it intersects H at exactly 2 points, since H is convex), then L will forever remain ‚Äúinside‚Äù H. Ultimately, L will take a cyclic tour around the inside of H, before returning to the starting pivot P. (Either way, our windmill process works, but it is instructive to consider the difference between L being inside vs outside H for such a simple S, before moving on to more complicated scenarios)<br><br><br>But what if S were to also contain some points either inside or outside of H? For instance, suppose S consists of the vertices of a single equilateral triangle, plus one point (C) in the center of it. Well, if we select P to be one of the vertices, and L to start outside the triangle, then L will forever remain outside the triangle, and will never hit C<br><br>On the other hand, if we select P = C (with L being any line that doesn‚Äôt hit the vertices), then the windmill process actually works out (in fact, we could actually choose any P to be any point of S, so long as we choose L to be inside the triangle, rather than starting outside). I leave it to the reader to ponder/verify this 4 point case, since we are about to show much more general results anyway (this was just an introduction to thinking about the problem)<br><br><br>Lemma 0 (Inside Now = Inside Forever): Let H be a convex polygon, whose vertices are in S. If P is a vertex of H, and L is any line through P that intersects H at more than one point, then the windmill process will leave L ‚Äútrapped‚Äù inside H forever. (That is, L will always intersect H at more than one point, at every moment, of every rotation about each pivot point)<br><br>Proof: In the intro, we saw how this works when S = H, but what if there are points inside H? (Or even outside, though that won‚Äôt actually matter)<br><br><br><br>Lemma 1: Let H_1 and H_2 be two convex polygons, whose vertices are in S, such that H_1 is contained in the interior of H_2. If P is a vertex of H_1, and L is any line that intersects H_1 only at P, then the windmill process on P and L will force L inside of H_1 (after a finite number of steps), and <br><br><br>Edit: If you‚Äôre reading this sentence, then I haven‚Äôt finished writing yet‚Ä¶ I press submit once in a while to avoid losing anything, so please come back in a couple hours üôÇ",2023-11-09T20:59:02Z

The operation modulo, or in the video &quot;mod&quot; achieves 2 things:<br><br>1) it reduces a whole number, no matter how small or large to a residue.<br><br>2) that residue is automatically between 0 and your modulo.<br><br>You essentially reduce all numbers to a residue between 0 and your modulo.

In other words, the equal distribution should be a property of the modulo operation itself in any unchanging, regular counting system with any unchanging base.

I am eager to hear insightful responses on this matter. In my view, the best approach to uncover meaningful patterns from feeding complex inputs into the zeta function may be to use a split screen: the left side could show the complex plane with dots of particular colors denoting complex inputs, while the right side maps those inputs through the zeta function, using the same colors to connect inputs to outputs. This visualization may reveal salient correspondences and patterns. The name &quot;1blueComplexInput1blueComplexOutput&quot; reflects this color-coded mapping of complex numbers. I believe this technique will yield valuable insights, patterns, and formulas relating complex inputs to outputs of this profound mathematical function.

further, the other alleged tense markers, &#39;-ed&#39; and &#39;-ing&#39;, can appear on adjectives and nouns as well. not to mention, the &#39;simple present tense&#39; is used to talk about things that are timelessly true, which by definition means it&#39;s not a tense. and &#39;-ed&#39; and &#39;-ing&#39; can appear with a past, present or future reference, so they obviously don&#39;t indicate tense either.<br><br>methinks similar things are going on with mathematics. the reason things seem so weird to you is that the rules you&#39;ve put your confidence in are simply wrong.<br><br>and honestly, it&#39;d be very weird if this weren&#39;t the case. for the most part, this type of mathematics derives from a roughly 50 year spurt of innovation in the early and mid-1800s, which strongly corresponds with the period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the Unification of Germany and the formation of the Kingdom of Italy. following this period of innovation was a period of codification, wherein we get figures like Georg Cantor, Giuseppe Peano, Richard Dedekind, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, etc. and the goal was to reformulate mathematics to encapsulate everything that was newly discovered in the early years of the 19th century. this period of codification ran roughly from the time of the Unification of Germany to the First World War.<br><br>after this, the major players in the mathematics industry suffered so many losses that it&#39;s accurate to say that we&#39;re looking at a mass extinction event in, not only mathematics, but across the sciences in general. in the wake of which the Vienna Circle grew to prominence, and with the rise of National Socialism, disbanded across the globe. where their ideology took hold just in time to seed the generation that would repopulate these industries after the second wave of mass extinction occurred during WWII. out of this we actually even specifically get Kuhn, who saw precisely what I&#39;m describing, but misinterpreted it as being about the quality of ideas, rather than repopulation events. but all of his examples of revolutions come immediately after horrendous wars, like Newton&#39;s rise in the immediate aftermath of the English Civil War.<br><br>and this pattern is in fact so robust that French mathematicians in the interwar period, recognizing that they were mostly students, largely ignorant of the nuances of the discoveries of the 19th century, came together and formed Nicolas Bourbaki in order to preserve what fragmented knowledge they had left between them. and this sets the stage for the era we&#39;re in now, and have been in since about the 1920s. which is an era of popularization.<br><br>so when you review this timeline it should strike you that the major pivotal moments come not due to any specific thing occurring within the field of mathematics, but things occurring in the world of geopolitics. the transition from innovation to codification came not because the innovation reached some specific level of sophistication, but because the way people thought about the world, and their place in it, changed. and this era of codification ended not because it was in any way finished, but because WWI happened. and the era of popularization occurred not because the two stages that came before were tidy enough to be disseminated to the masses, but because the risk of forgetting everything was a very real looming threat in the aftermath of WWI and WWII.<br><br>so, it&#39;s an odd position to take to say that this foundation which was hastily patched together by just a few men, under the belief that mathematics should be couched in the language of logic, a belief which was later shown to be misguided, is something that will stand the test of time. because there&#39;s absolutely no evidence supporting that conclusion.",2023-10-08T02:02:11Z

I think when I first heard someone reference fractional dimension like this I just thought it was nonsense, right? I mean, mathematicicans are clearly just making stuff up. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=2m29s"">2:29</a> Dimension is something that usually only makes sense for natural numbers, right? A line is one-dimensional; a plane, that&#39;s two dimensional; this space that we live in, that&#39;s three dimensional, and so on. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=2m38s"">2:38</a> ... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=4m25s"">4:25</a> Typically in math, the word that you use for this is &quot;Measure&quot;, but I think it might be more intuitive to talk about &quot;mass&quot;. As in, image that metal: A thin wire, a flat sheet, a solid cube, and some kind of Sierpinski mesh. Fractual dimension has everything to do with understanding how the mass of these shapes changes as you scale them. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=4m46s"">4:46</a> The benefit of starting the discussion with self-similar shapes is that it gives us a nice clear-cut way to compare masses. When you scale down that line by one half, the mass is also scaled down by one-half, which you can viscerally see because it takes two copies of that smaller one to form the whole. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=5m04s"">5:04</a> When you scale down a square by one-half, its mass is scaled down by one fourth, where again you can see this by piecing together four of the smaller copies to get the original. Likewise, when you scale down that cube by one half, the mass is scalled down by one eithth, or one-half cubed, because it takes eight copies of that. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=5m25s"">5:25</a> ... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=9m12s"">9:12</a> ... What I&#39;ve described so far, everything up to this point is what you might call &quot;self-similarity dimension&quot;. It does a good job making the idea of fractional dimension seem at least somewhat reasonable, but there&#39;s a problem. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&amp;t=9m26s"">9:26</a>",2023-09-21T11:34:08Z

And so is the width. So the area is a simple multiplication.<br><br>But in the case of a sphere, that length is a diameter of a circle, which has expanded left and right (one dimension), as well as forward and backwards (another dimension) in all possible ways you can turn.<br><br>Like a wave that forms when a stone is dropped in a pond of calm water. That circle has stretched out by its diameter. <br>And that diameter is our length. <br><br>If a circle has stretched out left and right, forward and backwards, that means the only other dimension left is up and down. <br>Meaning the circle can be flipped or rotate up and down.<br><br>So here&#39;s the question with area of a sphere.<br>How many times did a diameter of a circle which goes left and right, forward and backward, repeat itself in going up and down.<br><br>To visualize this...<br>Picture one circle, let&#39;s call it Circle A, with a diameter that goes left and right, forward and backwards. <br>Imagine that circle A is fitted inside another circle, let&#39;s call it Circle B with a diameter that goes up and down. <br><br>Now keep on drawing more circles like Circle A, as if to get a picture by picture rendition of rotating circle A around circle B provided they all fit in circle B, and it won&#39;t be long before you notice that you&#39;re tracing out the circumference of Circle B. <br><br>Equally so, you&#39;ll notice that there will be two ends of circle A, that will not rotate and will stay fixed. These two connected, form your diameter, such that if you&#39;re rotating circle A in circle B, there will be two points in circle A, that will not touch circle B and will stay fixed throughout the rotation. <br>The distance between these two points is what we are measuring the repetition of. <br><br>And so a very logical definition based meaning is that how many times did we repeat that diameter in going up and down. <br><br>Diameter is 2r. And the circumference is 2œÄr...<br>Multiply these two and you get your surface area. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if any of this made sense, but I&#39;m putting it out here to whoever will understand or care.<br><br>Aight!",2023-12-19T20:23:00Z

I know if you cut a triangle the end you cut off will fit backwards because the edge is guaranteed to be the same length along the cut, and that the cone is guaranteed to be a triangle from all angles when viewed along the plane.<br><br>3. a sphere that is tangent to the cone can be tangent to the intersection of the plane and the cone at two points, and will be centered on the intersection as well. because the cone and the plane are both symmetrical in this axis, their intersection will be symmetrical in this axis as well.<br><br>4. because the intersection is symmetrical across the shortest path through the center and the longest path through the center is perpendicular, I think, but I&#39;m not quite smart enough to piece together at this hour, that any line that passes through the center can be reflected by the long path to show a symmetry that means the cone could be sliced by the plane and then rotated 180 around an axis pependicular to the plane so that the shapes on either side of the slice match back up, showing that the shape is fully symmetrical along the long path of the intersection.<br><br>5. math in my head is hard, and I deserve a gold star for trying this<br><br>6.

The transformation must then only affect the other dimension of the plane hence why the slice of a cylinder is always a cone.

Therefore if you cut the cone in anyway other than perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the point then one side of your circle will be longer than the other because of the fact that the cone is not a static diameter along its hight.,2023-10-30T23:01:14Z

And it is also not surprising that it comes from a mathematician. Yes, of course it is more beautiful to have an algorithm that doesn&#39;t need to know the list of possible answers. It is more generic and hence more reusable. This is striving for perfection. However, was the initial goal to program a universal word solver? No, it wasn&#39;t. So, while striving for perfection, we lost focus of the actual goal. Thus, the resulting tool probably won&#39;t perform as well as it could. This is really a challenge for many engineers and programmers: Getting the perfectionist in you under control and keep the actual goal in focus instead of striving for the &quot;perfect&quot; solution, which surprisingly often isn&#39;t that perfect. Perfect is often the enemy of good. We see this at the very end, when he includes the list of possible solutions into the algorithm.",2023-09-23T09:05:37Z

When people ask a question like that &quot;here is a description of a person is he class A og B&quot;, it is not appropriate at all to assume this is person is randomly sampled from the population. i think what is instead implied, the way most people hear such a question, is that the person is sampled from the archetypes of their respective classes. Eg you take the x most libererian libererians and x most farmer farmers, and pick one. why would you say its eigther a farmer or a liberarian if not. Is a more valid answer that you think hes a teacher because those are more common?<br><br>now i would say as an example to teach bayes theorem, this is not that bad. However many people will use such thought experiments to try to convince people to use a more &quot;logical&quot; mindset. The fact is in the real world when you are faced with a question like that, not asked by someone that designed it to trick you, cleansing your mindset from context, and trying to find a few variables and use math will be less accurate than using your intuition on the whole context of the question asked, why it was asked, who asked, etc.",2023-12-05T18:22:13Z

It seems to just describe a static reality... But the interpretation is a dynamical/iterative scheme to update subjective belief. <br><br>The libertarian-farmer example has a hypothesis that has a well defined prior probability (the fraction of librarian is a objective reality). In other context, the probability about belief is fundamentally ill defined. For instance, the likelihood of string theory is correct (over all current theory) has a definite binary answer while our assignment of prior probability is totally ill defined and subjective... This example is more about updating subjective belief while the librarian-farmer example is more about describing well defined static reality.

Unfortunately, rotations around these points wouldn&#39;t look like rotation that you&#39;re familiar with, but if the axis was through the origin, it would be normal rotation, and the closer you are to the origin, the more like Euclidean rotation it becomes. This could be described by two of the quaternion components being infinitesimally small, though at that point, why not just throw universal inverses out the window and say that those two basis vectors actually have a magnitude of 0 despite being non-zero. This is something that some mathematicians might scoff at or become horrified by, but it&#39;s actually used in a number system called the &quot;dual numbers,&quot; which are to flat euclidean space what complex numbers are to spherical and elliptic space.<br><br>Because i, j, and k are stupid names, I&#39;m instead going to use dÃÇxÃÇ, ≈∑dÃÇ, and xÃÇ≈∑. You can then represent any 2D point (x, y) as xÃÇ≈∑ + x≈∑dÃÇ + ydÃÇxÃÇ (If this feels backwards, that&#39;d because points aren&#39;t actually the primitive in this space, and they&#39;re actually built from a more fundamental element.) This is very similar to a quaternion, but with two of the imaginary components (the two including a factor of dÃÇ) squaring to 0 rather than -1. These can also be exponentiated just like quaternions, but the different squares makes things slightly different. Namely, a rotation of Œ∏ around a normalized point PÃÇ (normalized meaning that |PÃÇ|¬≤ = 1) can be described as exp(Œ∏PÃÇ/2) = cos(Œ∏/2) + PÃÇsin(Œ∏/2).<br><br>If you&#39;re in 3D, then you can&#39;t rotate around arbitrary points unless you also have a plane parallel to the desired rotation. In general, 3D rotations happen around lines, which have <i>6</i> degrees of freedom. They can be represented analogously to points in terms of the basis dÃÇxÃÇ, dÃÇ≈∑, dÃÇ·∫ë, xÃÇ≈∑, ·∫ëxÃÇ, and ≈∑·∫ë. The components of these actually correspond to the Pl√ºcker coordinates of the line. The dÃÇxÃÇ, dÃÇ≈∑, and xÃÇ≈∑ components also have nearly identical meaning as in the 2D case, while the xÃÇ≈∑, ·∫ëxÃÇ, and ≈∑·∫ë have nearly identical meaning to the i, j, and k basis quaternions, though not necessarily in that order depending on who you ask. These Pl√ºcker coordinates form a 6D subspace of an 8D system called &quot;dual quaternions,&quot; which can represent arbitrary rotations around arbitrary axes in 3D, along with screw motions and translations. Exponentiating these is a little more complicated than the 2D case, since the input might not actually be a valid line. In that case, the result is not just a rotation around an axis, but a screw motion around <i>and along</i> said axis.<br><br>What I&#39;ve given here is based on Projective Geometric Algebra, which can describe translations, rotations, reflections, point-reflections, and any composition of them in N dimensions. It also has dedicated separate objects for planes, lines, and points, each of which can also be described as some composition of orthogonal reflections.<br><br><br>P.S. Most sources will use e‚ÇÄ, e‚ÇÅ, e‚ÇÇ, and e‚ÇÉ instead of dÃÇ, xÃÇ, ≈∑,and ·∫ë respectively. My use of xÃÇ, ≈∑,and ·∫ë should be fairly self explanatory, while dÃÇ I chose due to being related to the distance of a plane from the origin, along with differentials in the dual-number formulation of calculus, and of course the names of &quot;dual numbers&quot; and &quot;dual quaternions.&quot;",2023-07-13T04:28:38Z

Dual Quaternions also help retain volume. With matrix interpolation, you get the candy wrapper effect when you twist (center between two bones goes to a single point).

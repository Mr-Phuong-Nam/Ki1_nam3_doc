The character in the video is definitely struggling with ADHD, and hence has serious time management problems. I don&#39;t think working from the office would solve the problem here. Actually, even more problems would arise, because if he can&#39;t make it on time to an online video from the bed how you expect him to be on time for an on-site meeting? Managers should focus more on the results of their subordinates and meeting deadlines, not where the employee&#39;s butt is :) If you want them to start early, just set early meetings - nobody likes them, but hey, for good money who cares ;)",2023-11-16T09:33:41Z

However, the amount this guy took is definitely a whole trip and not micro for filming purposes.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=0m19s"">0:19</a> &quot;...part of your DAO&quot;. DAO means decentralized autonomous organization. Usually run by a whole community, but... not really. This is why the DAO founder says, &quot;fuck the community.&quot;<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=0m45s"">0:45</a> LP means liquidity provider. Usually, a DeFi project requires you to deposit money in it to make use of it, just like how you deposit money in a bank. For example, a lending protocol will allow you to lend money to other borrowers. So you&#39;re adding liquidity into the project, so you&#39;re an LP, liquidity provider.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=1m04s"">1:04</a> Su Zhu is Zhu Su; he&#39;s a very successful crypto trader <a href=""https://twitter.com/zhusu"">https://twitter.com/zhusu</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=1m44s"">1:44</a> Olympus and Wonderland are decentralized reserve currency projects, but some might say it&#39;s only to obfuscate a Ponzi game. Technically this project is supposed to bring stability into their native token by being backed by various crypto assets. So if you think the crypto assets like ETH and BTC are too volatile, then you can buy OHM (Olympus tokens) to stabilize the price since it&#39;s backed by a multitude of crypto tokens. This is kind of similar to how stablecoins are backed by real USD. But he&#39;s questioning why is USD the &quot;stable&quot; currency? Who knows, if we break out into a civil war, the USD dollar might become shit, so what is stability anyways?<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=1m55s"">1:55</a> Anything can be a store of value as long as there&#39;s a demand for it and it&#39;s limited. For example, Hermes Birkin bags are very sought after, like Rolex watches.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=2m01s"">2:01</a> There are many DeFi projects in the space, most of them are just ways to get users to add liquidity to their project, unfortunately. They would have many tactics to mask their true intentions.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=2m12s"">2:12</a> DeFi 2.0 protocols are a new wave of projects. Olympus/Wonderland are a part of that wave. This video explains DeFi 2.0 very well: <a href=""https://youtu.be/l0vRTi8_FRk"">https://youtu.be/l0vRTi8_FRk</a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=2m20s"">2:20</a> This is how decentralized reserve currency projects work (Olympus/Wonderland); they&#39;re trying to put a lot of different coins into the treasury so their native token will be backed by those coins rather than the US dollar.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=2m34s"">2:34</a> You tend to get an extremely high APY in DeFi projects, but they&#39;re clearly not sustainable<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=2m56s"">2:56</a> &quot;another staking reward.&quot; Many times, the projects want to keep their native token price high so it&#39;s more attractive to users. To do that, they want the users to hold their tokens and not sell them off. So they would create these staking rewards to reward people who do not sell off their tokens.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=3m20s"">3:20</a> Scam projects often have founders dump their native tokens on their users while the price is still high<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHEZCXfyxjU&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a> Sifu is a co-founder of Wonderland who took $5.5M from the treasury. <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/01/address-linked-to-wonderlands-sifu-cashes-out-28m-worth-of-ether/"">https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/01/address-linked-to-wonderlands-sifu-cashes-out-28m-worth-of-ether/</a><br><br>Hope that helps!",2022-04-08T15:39:20Z

Actually, even more problems would arise, because if he can&#39;t make it on time to an online video from the bed how you expect him to be on time for an on-site meeting? Managers should focus more on the results of their subordinates and meeting deadlines, not where the employee&#39;s butt is :) If you want them to start early, just set early meetings - nobody likes them, but hey, for good money who cares ;)",2023-11-16T09:33:41Z

If I understand it correctly this would be 100% &quot;modular.&quot; Like you could plug in any equation for a 3d object into the program, you could use a different lighting vector, or you could change the angular velocity of the object any way you like and it would still work and give you a different animation.",2023-12-17T17:04:11Z

Writing the program requires someone who knows the programming language and how to translate the steps in the algorithm into code.<br>These are 3 distinct responsibilities requiring 3 distinct skills.<br>Having one person do all 3 minimizes the number of people but at the cost of the degradation of all 3.<br>The best way to have all 3 people is to have enough work to keep all 3 busy.<br>I learned math when I was 6 months old and my father taught me how to count to 20 then how to do arithmetic.<br>It also helps if you start young and have parents who let you pursue your interests.,2023-11-05T12:19:01Z

I personally created a Day Trading bot that Day trades all day, every day on Robinhood and I also created a security camera program with OpenCV used as a motion detector to take images of anyone who enters my room, save the image, then immediately shutdown the computer. I plan on integrating him with my own personal virtual assistant (Ultron) so he can upload the image via Whatsapp and turn off the Day Trading bot in case something goes wrong when I&#39;m not home. The security cam is actually supposed to protect my Day Trading bot while I am not home by shutting down the computer upon intrusion.<br><br>I&#39;m actually working on a Whatsapp UI in the form of a virtual assistant named Ultron who can control my computer when I am away from home and chat with me through Emerson AI and soon enough I will also add the option of chatting with blenderbot as an available alternative through Ultron. Basically you would send Ultron a command via text with a reserved symbol (&#39;!&#39;) followed by the command itself and any parameters you would like to add with the &#39;#&#39; symbol. Ultron then parses the text to differentiate between a text message and a command and currently sends those text messages to Emerson AI and sends his response via Whatsapp, then he runs the commands in order.<br><br>You can actually chain multiple commands together this way so they can be executed in order, such as uploading a screenshot of the computer followed by shutting down the computer or something. Its super radical!",2022-10-11T17:04:28Z

My employment situation is going downhill since I started to learn how to code. Im no longer satisfied just being an electronic tech.  Electronic tech is so poorüò¢ we half to know as much as the engineers but only get paid 1/2 to 1/4 of the wages. In the last few months I&#39;ve been taking ml and deep ai course. Yes they only focus on building models and I complained about that. Don&#39;t know if software engineering is in the card yet. But I&#39;ll keep away at it while I&#39;m unemployed agian.,2023-04-26T19:26:25Z

You will often look back &amp; wish you had gone that route when you are stuck with boring old Nelly for the 45th year because she was &quot;the responsible one&quot;. We always look back &amp; wish we had done more or had more fun, many people in the late years often realize the safe route was boring &amp; actually the most problematic route since you also more than likely got with someone that has too high of standards &amp; now you both are miserable &amp; you made some miserable kids &amp; worst case scenario you start a multi-generational chain of miserable people. <br><br>I&#39;m just here to listen to tinder tips but my dude if you are enjoying someone&#39;s company that&#39;s pretty rare &amp; don&#39;t toss them out because of their background or because they don&#39;t make enough money.

If someone could tell me why it is faster I would appreciate that cause I don&#39;t even know myself. Here it is:<br>def fibonacci(n):<br>    a = []<br>    while len(a) == 0:¬†<br>        a.append(0)<br>    while len(a) == 1:<br>        a.append(1)<br>    while n &gt; len(a):<br>        a.append(a[len(a) - 1] + a[len(a) - 2])<br>    return a[n-1],2021-08-11T04:05:06Z

They are designed for writing code and color code based on different languages and have extensions so you can customize.  They&#39;ll warn of syntax errors, spelling errors, variables not in use, and so on. They&#39;ll also autoformat, lint check, bracket match, auto-complete code, intellisense, auto-rename matching tags, auto-close tags, and so much more.  I don&#39;t think vi does any of that, plus you have to change modes between insert, overwrite and command mode.

These big tech companies will be the ones leading the charge, creating robot armies to do their bidding and enforcing their will on all of us lowly humans. Microsoft and Google will eventually merge into one super company called &quot;GooSoft&quot; and their AI will be so powerful that it will be able to control the weather, summon dragons, and even bake the perfect chocolate chip cookie. But don&#39;t worry, GooSoft&#39;s benevolent overlords will take good care of us... as long as we don&#39;t forget to pay our monthly subscription fee.

From the points you&#39;ve made, the ones that resonate the most are the &quot;unity of the team&quot; and &quot;if we need to take control then we&#39;ve chosen the wrong people to back&quot; (or something to that effect). Lots of people work poorly together, but in my experience (I do lowly engineering/consultant work) you sort of have to watch them work in a natural environment (as opposed to being on their best behavior while you&#39;re there). Poor communication is probably the most common one. Whatever small problems they may have, would get multiplied by 100x at later stages. I know this sounds kind of funny, but in a subjective way, the team members have to kind of love each other yet also have the motivation/resolve to push each other&#39;s abilities.

Maximum greed with minimal involvement. Lazy. It&#39;s a different ideology. Kind of like.. is money your only objective? Or are you trying to build genuine relationships with people and have profound effects on the industries you get involved in? Although I do entirely different type of work, the mistake I often see from business owners is obsession with minor stats they get from BI and forgetting to focus on &quot;the business of the business&quot;. The thing I always end up shoving down their throats is &quot;look, you have to serve your customers first&quot;. Customer voices + feedback have a ton of weight. My &quot;customer-centric&quot; ideology often clashes with other contractors who are number-centric, or who end up using finite resources to achieve something that has zero impact on conversion/growth/etc. Always fun. I keep on having to say silly stuff like &quot;do you guys remember that you&#39;re serving actual humans?&quot;. This point seems to get lost so easily.

It&#39;s more marked with my condition, Schizophrenia. But really the state of the art with what science thinks is going on is brain chemistry.  Basically Dopamine is different in schizophrenics.  But in terms of systems,   If you think about fear,   as a systemic process we see something that triggers our brain to go into a different mode which manifests chemical changes, so experience provokes brain chemistry, adrenaline. Adrenaline impacts psychology.  So experience impacts chemistry which impacts psychology.<br><br>It&#39;s interesting to think that this is how a lot of stuff might work with psychology and mood. <br><br>People always think about Depression now in terms of chemistry, but it&#39;s almost like the perception of brain chemistry for a depressive is you are passive. You&#39;re unlucky in terms of the brain you got doesn&#39;t work right. And you sit back and take meds because your brain works the way it works irrespective.<br><br>Does this passive attitude submit.  Because if the condition is a symbiotic cycle, then the cycle for a clinical depressive will be a loop that perpetuates. So there will be no logical difference between the perception that you have no choice, and that being the reality. That you have no choice..<br><br>Because the data, the experience in the system, manifests the same result.<br><br>People always seem to think everything about the condition is a constant. And really experience is a variable. It&#39;s not going to be the complete picture because different people have different chemistry and also different psychology. So the proposition that this is like a machine would rely on chemistry and psychology in terms of response being the same, which patently it isn&#39;t. But what it does do is change one of the constants in perception from a constant to a variable. And you wonder is modulation of this variable enough to leverage mood. <br><br>Bullshit really. But they always say do practical things... Experience..",2019-04-02T08:08:18Z

Positive people.  People think people with a positive attitude is nature. We were born with the nature we were born with. But like,  if you think about experience and choice manifests chemistry..  If a component of positive attitude is chemistry..  Chemistry is a consequence of experience, is there a mathematical route to depression?  Like abuse in kids makes emotional problems in later life.. <br><br>So that&#39;s experience manifests psychology and chemical responses.. So experience manifested chemical reflexes that carried through into adulthood.  That&#39;s experience that didn&#39;t need to happen.

For heavens sakes, I didn‚Äôt realize that I was in preschool needing permission from her to wear it, LOL, that‚Äôs it, never went to her after that, <br><br>Depression is not an easy thing, a lot of people don‚Äôt realize that, I don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs sympathy, just like yourself, but it‚Äôs since to know that there are people who do care.<br><br>I wish you the best!",2019-05-30T07:24:38Z
